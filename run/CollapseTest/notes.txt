CollapseTestNonCosmological
------------------------

This test problem initializes a constant density sphere at the center of the box 
with radius of 0.15 of the box width.  The sphere is in pressure equilibrium with 
its surroundings.  The sphere will collapse dynamically and reach its peak density 
at t ~ 5.2 in code units.  Radiative cooling is turned off, so the sphere will bounce 
and reach an equilibrium state.

This test runs to completion (t = 7) and produces 71 outputs in roughly an hour 
on a single processor.  In plot.py, we plot the evolution of the peak density versus 
time create density projections for each output.

Note for comparing with Enzo 1.5 - By default, Enzo 2.0 performs 4 iterations of 
the multigrid gravity solver (configurable with the PotentialIterations parameter).  
However, the default number of potential iteration in Enzo 1.5 is 0 and there is 
no parameter to change this.  For a direct comparison, Enzo 1.5 must be compiled 
with MAX_POTENTIAL_ITERATIONS (in macros_and_parameters.h) set to 4.
