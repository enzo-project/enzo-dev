Burkert-Bodenheimer Test
#This is based off the initial conditions given in Fedderath et al. 2010. It shows the collapse of a
#rotating sphere. Particles should form in the bar at the centre. The test is not part of the test
#infrastrure because it is, at the moment, difficult to automate



# To run the test
# There is a bit of a palaver to get this running as the mechanism for
# running enzo with the gravitational potential (GP) turned on is a little
# difficult - in particular I don't think there is a currently a way to get
# enzo to run with the GP calculation from the start. So here is how I do it:

1. ./enzo.exe -d BBCollapseTestSmartStarParticle.enzo
2. This will die after a couple of seconds - that's ok
3. ./enzo.exe -d -g DD0000/DD0000    #this turns on the gravitational potential
4. mpirun -np X ./enzo.exe -d -r GravPotential/DD0000/DD0000

This will run relatively slowly i.e. tens of minutes on around 32 cores. This is another reason
why this is currently not part of the test infrastructure. With the current setup the first particles
should appears in output DD0133. 


#Results
The test should form 2 particles initially at the ends of a bar that forms in the middle of the
collapsing sphere. Several particles will subsequently form along the bar as the bar fragments. 

#Plots
Plots can be made of the collapse using sinkslices.py
