This is a cosmology simulation that runs to z = 0 with tabulated
radiative cooling and conventional, non-radiative star formation and
feedback.  It will run on 2 processors in about 40 minutes.

note: you'll need a cool_rates.in file, which can be found in the inputs
directory

Usage:
./inits.exe -d AMRCosmology.inits
mpirun -np 2 ./ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
mpirun -np 2 ./enzo.exe -d AMRCosmology.enzo
