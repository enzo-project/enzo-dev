Enzo Parameter List
===================

The following is a largely complete list of the parameters that Enzo
understands, and a brief description of what they mean. They are grouped
roughly by meaning; an alphabetical list is also available. Parameters for
individual test problems are also listed here.

This parameter list has two purposes. The first is to describe and explain the
parameters that can be put into the initial parameter file that begins a run.
The second is to provide a comprehensive list of all parameters that the code
uses, including those that go into an output file (which contains a complete
list of all parameters), so that users can better understand these output
files.

The parameters fall into a number of categories:

**external**
    These are user parameters in the sense that they can be set in the
    parameter file, and provide the primary means of communication
    between Enzo and the user.
**internal**
    These are mostly not set in the parameter file (although strictly
    speaking they can be) and are generally used for program to
    communicate with itself (via the restart of output files).
**obsolete**
    No longer used.
**reserved**
    To be used later.

Generally the external parameters are the only ones that are modified or set,
but the internal parameters can provide useful information and can sometimes be
modified so I list them here as well. Some parameters are true/false or on/off
boolean flags.  Eventually, these may be parsed, but in the meantime, we use the
common convention of 0 meaning false or off and 1 for true or on.

.. _initialization_parameters:

Initialization Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``TopGridRank`` (external)
    This specifies the dimensionality of the root grid and by extension
    the entire hierarchy. It should be 1,2 or 3. Default: none
``TopGridDimensions`` (external)
    This is the dimension of the top or root grid. It should consist of
    1, 2 or 3 integers separated by spaces. For those familiar with the
    KRONOS or ZEUS method of specifying dimensions, these values do not
    include ghost or boundary zones. A dimension cannot be less than 3
    zones wide and more than ``MAX_ANY_SINGLE_DIRECTION`` -
    ``NumberOfGhostZones``\*2. ``MAX_ANY_SINGLE_DIRECTION`` is defined in
    ``fortran.def``. Default: none
``DomainLeftEdge``, ``DomainRightEdge`` (external)
    These float values specify the two corners of the problem domain
    (in code units). The defaults are: 0 0 0 for the left edge and 1 1
    1 for the right edge.
``LeftFaceBoundaryCondition``, ``RightFaceBoundaryCondition`` (external)
    These two parameters each consist of vectors of integers (of length
    ``TopGridRank``). They specify the boundary conditions for the top grid
    (and hence the entire hierarchy). The first integer corresponds to
    the x-direction, the second to the y-direction and the third, the
    z-direction. The possible values are: 0 - reflecting, 1 - outflow,
    2 - inflow, 3 - periodic, 4 - shearing. For inflow, the inflow
    values can be set through the next parameter, or more commonly are
    controlled by problem-specific code triggered by the ``ProblemType``.
    For shearing boundaries, the boundary pair in another direction
    must be periodic. Note that self gravity will not be consistent
    with shearing boundary conditions. Default: 0 0 0
``BoundaryConditionName`` (external)
    While the above parameters provide an easy way to set an entire
    side of grid to a given boundary value, the possibility exists to
    set the boundary conditions on an individual cell basis. This is
    most often done with problem specific code, but it can also be set
    by specifying a file which contains the information in the
    appropriate format. This is too involved to go into here. Default:
    none
``StoreDomainBoundaryMassFlux`` (external)
    When turned on, this stores the cumulative mass (in solar masses)
    of density fields (density, species fields, metallicity) that
    outflows from the simulation domain. This is stored directly
    in the output parameter files as the ``BoundaryMassFluxFieldNumbers``
    and ``BoundaryMassFluxContainer`` parameters, as well as
    the cycle-by-cycle mass outflow in ``BoundaryMassFluxFilename``.
    Default : 0 (off)
``BoundaryMassFluxFilename`` (external)
    The filename to output the cycle-by-cyle mass outflow from the
    grid domain when the above parameter is ON. Default : 'boundary_mass_flux.dat'
``InitialTime`` (internal)
    The time, in code units, of the current step. For cosmology the
    units are in free-fall times at the initial epoch (see :ref:`EnzoOutputFormats`). Default: generally 0, depending on problem
``Initialdt`` (internal)
    The timestep, in code units, for the current step. For cosmology
    the units are in free-fall times at the initial epoch (see :ref:`EnzoOutputFormats`). Default: generally 0, depending on problem
``Unigrid`` (external)
    This parameter should be set to 1 (TRUE) for large cases--AMR as
    well as non-AMR--where the root grid is 512\ :sup:`3`\  or larger.
    This prevents initialization under subgrids at start up, which is
    unnecessary in cases with simple non-nested initial conditions.
    Unigrid must be set to 0 (FALSE) for cases with nested initial
    conditions. Default: 0 (FALSE). See also ``ParallelRootGridIO`` in :ref:`io_parameters`.
``UnigridTranspose`` (external)
    This parameter governs the fast FFT bookkeeping for Unigrid runs.
    Does not work with isolated gravity.  Option 0 is the slowest of
    the methods.  Option 1 is an aggressive version that is
    memory-intensive.  Option 2 tries to conserve memory at the
    expense of performance.  See also ``Unigrid`` above.  Default: 2.
``MaximumTopGridTimeStep`` (external)
    This parameter limits the maximum timestep on the root grid.  Default: huge_number.
``ShearingVelocityDirection`` (external)
    Select direction of shearing boundary. Default is x direction. Changing this is probably not a good idea.
``AngularVelocity`` (external)
    The value of the angular velocity in the shearing boundary.
    Default: 0.001
``VelocityGradient`` (external)
    The value of the per code length gradient in the angular velocity
    in the shearing boundary. Default: 1.0
``GridVelocity`` (external)
    The whole computational domain will have this velocity.  Experimental.  Default: 0 0 0
``StringKick`` (external)
    While this parameter was initially designed to describe the kick by cosmic strings in CosmologySimulation, it can be used to model the velocity (in km/s) that the baryons should move relative to dark matter at the initial redshift, in order to study the effect discussed by Tseliakhovich & Hirata (astro-ph:1005.2416). Default: 0
``StringKickDimension`` (external)
    This parameter is used to control the orthogonal direction of the flow.  Default: 0 (x-axis)
``MemoryLimit`` (external)
    If the memory usage on a single MPI process exceeds this number, then the simulation will halt after outputting.  Only used when the compile-time define MEM_TRACE is used. Default: 4e9
``HydrogenFractionByMass`` (external)
    This parameter is used to set up initial conditions in some test problems.  Default: 0.76
``DeuteriumToHydrogenRatio`` (external)
    This parameter is used to set up initial conditions in some test problems.  Default: 2.0*3.4e-5 (Burles & Tytler 1998, the parameter here is by mass, so multiply by 2)
``SolarMetalFractionByMass`` (external)
    This parameter is used to set up initial conditions in some test problems. Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing. Default: 0.02041
``CoolDataIh2co`` (external)
    Whether to include molecular hydrogen cooling.  Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Default: 1
``CoolDataIpiht`` (external)
    Whether to include photoionization heating.  Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Default: 1
``CoolDataCompXray`` (external)
    Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Saved to CoolData.comp_xray. Default: 0
``CoolDataTempXray`` (external)
    Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Saved to CoolData.temp_xray. Default: 0
``NumberOfTemperatureBins`` (external)
    Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing. Default: 600
``TemperatureStart`` (external)
    Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing. Default: 10
``TemperatureEnd`` (external)
    Do NOT change this parameter unless you know exactly what you are doing. Default: 1e8
``ExternalBoundaryIO`` (external)
    not recommended for use at this point. Only works if compiled with ``ooc-boundary-yes``.  Default: 0
``ExternalBoundaryTypeIO`` (external)
    not recommended for use at this point. Default: 0
``ExternalBoundaryValueIO`` (external)
    not recommended for use at this point. Default: 0
``SimpleConstantBoundary`` (external)
    not recommended for use at this point. Default: 0

.. _io_parameters:

I/O Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _general_io_parameters:

General I/O Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three ways to specify the frequency of outputs:
time-based, cycle-based (a cycle is a top-grid timestep), and, for
cosmology simulations, redshift-based. There is also a shortened
output format intended for visualization (movie format). Please
have a look at :ref:`controlling_data_output` for more information.

``dtDataDump`` (external)
    The time interval, in code units, between time-based outputs. A
    value of 0 turns off the time-based outputs. Default: 0
``dtInterpolatedDataDump`` (external)
    The time interval, in code units, between time-based interpolated outputs. A
    value of 0 turns off the time-based outputs. Default: 0
``CycleSkipDataDump`` (external)
    The number of cycles (top grid timesteps) between cycle-based
    outputs. Zero turns off the cycle-based outputs. Default: 0
``SubcycleSkipDataDump`` (external)
    The number of subcycles between subcycle-based
    outputs. Zero turns off the subcycle-based outputs. Default: 0
``dtTracerParticleDump`` (external)
    The time interval, in code units, between time-based tracer particle outputs (defined in ComputeRandomForcingNormalization.C). A
    value of 0 turns off this output. Default: 0
``DataDumpName`` (external)
    The base file name used for both time and cycle based outputs.
    Default: data
``RedshiftDumpName`` (external)
    The base file name used for redshift-based outputs (this can be
    overridden by the ``CosmologyOutputRedshiftName`` parameter). Normally
    a four digit identification number is appended to the end of this
    name, starting from 0000 and incrementing by one for every output.
    This can be over-ridden by including four consecutive R's in the
    name (e.g. RedshiftRRRR) in which case an identification number
    will not be appended but the four R's will be converted to a
    redshift with an implied decimal point in the middle (i.e. z=1.24
    becomes 0124). Default: RedshiftOutput
``TracerParticleDumpName`` (external)
    The base file name used for tracer particle outputs.
    Default:
``TracerParticleDumpDir`` (external)
    The dir name used for tracer particle outputs.
    Default:
``dtRestartDump``
    Reserved for future use.
``dtHistoryDump``
    Reserved for future use.
``CycleSkipRestartDump``
    Reserved for future use.
``CycleSkipHistoryDump``
    Reserved for future use.
``RestartDumpName``
    Reserved for future use.
``HistoryDumpName``
    Reserved for future use.
``CosmologyOutputRedshift[NNNN]`` (external)
    The time and cycle-based outputs occur regularly at constant
    intervals, but the redshift outputs are specified individually.
    This is done by the use of this statement, which sets the output
    redshift for a specific identification number (this integer is
    between 0000 and 9999 and is used in forming the name). So the
    statement ``CosmologyOutputRedshift[1] = 4.0`` will cause an output to
    be written out at z=4 with the name RedshiftOutput0001 (unless the
    base name is changed either with the previous parameter or the next
    one). This parameter can be repeated with different values for the
    number (NNNN) Default: none
``CosmologyOutputRedshiftName[NNNN]`` (external)
    This parameter overrides the parameter ``RedshiftOutputName`` for this
    (only only this) redshift output. Can be used repeatedly in the
    same manner as the previous parameter. Default: none
``FileDirectedOutput``
    If this parameter is set to 1, whenever the finest level has finished
    evolving Enzo will check for new signal files to output.  (See
    :ref:`force_output_now`.)  Default 1.
``TracerParticleOn``
    This parameter is used to set the velocities of the tracer
    particles equal to the gas velocities in the current cells.
    Tracer particles are massless and can be used to output values of
    the gas as they advect with the fluid.  Default: 0
``TracerParticleOutputVelocity``
    This parameter is used to output tracer particle velocity as well
    as position, density, and temperature.  Default: 0
``OutputFirstTimeAtLevel`` (external)
    This forces Enzo to output when a given level is reached, and at
    every level thereafter. Default is 0 (off). User can usefully
    specify anything up to the maximum number of levels in a given
    simulation.
``ParallelRootGridIO`` (external)
    Normally for the mpi version, the root grid is read into the root
    processor and then partitioned to separate processors using communication.
    However, for
    very large root grids (e.g. 512\ :sup:`3`\ ), the root processor
    may not have enough memory. If this toggle switch is set on (i.e.
    to the value 1), then each processor reads its own section of the
    root grid. More I/O is required (to split up the grids and
    particles), but it is more balanced in terms of memory.
    ``ParallelRootGridIO`` and ``ParallelParticleIO`` MUST be set to 1 (TRUE)
    for runs involving > 64 cpus! Default: 0 (FALSE).
    See ``ParallelParticleIO`` in :ref:`particle_parameters`.
    See also ``Unigrid`` in :ref:`initialization_parameters`.
``OutputTemperature`` (external)
    Set to 1 if you want to output a temperature field in the datasets.
    Always 1 for cosmology simulations. Default: 0.
``OutputCoolingTime`` (external)
    Set to 1 if you want to output the cooling time in the datasets.
    Default: 0.
``OutputSmoothedDarkMatter`` (external)
    Set to 1 if you want to output a dark matter density field,
    smoothed by an SPH kernel. Set to 2 to also output smoothed dark
    matter velocities and velocity dispersion. Set to 0 to turn off.
    Default: 0.
``SmoothedDarkMatterNeighbors`` (external)
    Number of nearest neighbors to smooth dark matter quantities over.
    Default: 32.
``OutputGriddedStarParticle`` (external)
    Set to 1 or 2 to write out star particle data gridded onto mesh.
    This will be useful e.g. if you have lots of star particles in a
    galactic scale simulation. 1 will output just
    ``star_particle_density``; and 2 will dump
    ``actively_forming_stellar_mass_density``, ``SFR_density``, etc.
    Default: 0.
``PopIIIOutputOnFeedback`` (external)
    Writes an interpolated output when a Pop III is formed or goes
    supernova.  Default: 0
``OutputOnDensity`` (external)
    Should interpolated outputs be generated at varying peak density?
    Default: 0
``StartDensityOutput`` (external)
    The first density (in log g/cc) at which to output.
``CurrentDensityOutput`` (internal)
    The most recent density at which output was generated.
``IncrementDensityOutput`` (external)
    After a density-directed output, how much should the density be increased by?  Default: 999
``ComputePotential`` (external)
    When turned on, the gravitational potential is computed and stored in memory.  Always done when SelfGravity is on.  Default: 0
``WritePotential`` (external)
    When turned on, the gravitational potential is written to file.  Default: 0
``WriteGhostZones`` (external)
    Should ghost zones be written to disk?  Default: 0
``ReadGhostZones`` (external)
    Are ghost zones present in the files on disk?  Default: 0
``VelAnyl`` (external)
    Set to 1 if you want to output the divergence and vorticity of
    velocity. Works in 2D and 3D.
``BAnyl`` (external)
    Set to 1 if you want to output the divergence and vorticity of
    ``Bfield``. Works in 2D and 3D.
``ExtractFieldsOnly`` (external)
    Used for extractions (enzo -x ...) when only field data are needed
    instead of field + particle data. Default is 1 (TRUE).
``XrayLowerCutoffkeV``, ``XrayUpperCutoffkeV``, ``XrayTableFileName`` (external)
    These parameters are used in 2D projections (``enzo -p ...``). The
    first two specify the X-ray band (observed at z=0) to be used, and
    the last gives the name of an ascii file that contains the X-ray
    spectral information. A gzipped version of this file good for
    bands within the 0.1 - 20 keV range is provided in the
    distribution in ``input/lookup_metal0.3.data``. If these
    parameters are specified, then the second field is replaced with
    integrated emissivity along the line of sight in units of 10\
    :sup:`-23` erg/cm\ :sup:`2`/s. Default: ``XrayLowerCutoffkeV =
    0.5``, ``XrayUpperCutoffkeV = 2.5``.
``ParticleTypeInFile`` (external)
    Output ParticleType to disk?  Default: 1
``OutputParticleTypeGrouping`` (external)
    In the grid HDF5 groups, particles are sorted by type, and a reference is created to indicate which particle index range corresponds to each type.  Default: 0
``HierarchyFileInputFormat`` (external)
    See :ref:`controlling_the_hierarhcy_file_output`.
``HierarchyFileOutputFormat`` (external)
    See :ref:`controlling_the_hierarhcy_file_output`.
``TimingCycleSkip`` (external)
    Controls how many cycles to skip when timing information is collected, reduced, and written out to performance.out.  Default: 1
``DatabaseLocation`` (external)
    (Not recommended for use at this point)  Where should the SQLite database of outputs be placed?
``CubeDumpEnabled`` (external)
    not recommended for use at this point. Default: 0
``CubeDump[]`` (external)
    not recommended for use at this point
``LocalDir`` (external)
    See :ref:`controlling_data_output`.
``GlobalDir`` (external)
    See :ref:`controlling_data_output`.

.. _stopping_parameters:

Stopping Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``StopTime`` (external)
    This parameter specifies the time (in code units) when the
    calculation will halt. For cosmology simulations, this variable is
    automatically set by ``CosmologyFinalRedshift``. *No default.*
``StopCycle`` (external)
    The cycle (top grid timestep) at which the calculation stops. A
    value of zero indicates that this criterion is not be used.
    *Default: 100,000*
``StopFirstTimeAtLevel`` (external)
    Causes the simulation to immediately stop when a specified level is
    reached. Default value 0 (off), possible values are levels 1
    through maximum number of levels in a given simulation.
``StopFirstTimeAtDensity`` (external)
    Causes the simulation to immediately stop when the maximum gas
    density reaches this value.  In units of proper g/cm^3.  Not used if less
    than or equal to zero. Default: 0.0
``StopFirstTimeAtMetalEnrichedDensity`` (external)
    Causes the simulation to immediately stop when the maximum gas
    density with above some metallicity, specified by
    ``EnrichedMetalFraction``, is reached.  In units of g/cm^3.  Not
    used if less than or equal to zero.  Default: 0.0
``EnrichedMetalFraction`` (external)
    See ``StopFirstTimeAtMetalEnrichedDensity``.  In units of absolute
    metal fraction.  Default: 1e-8
``NumberOfOutputsBeforeExit`` (external)
    After this many datadumps have been written, the code will exit.  If
    set to 0 (default), this option will not be used.  Default: 0.
``StopCPUTime`` (external)
    Causes the simulation to stop if the wall time exceeds ``StopCPUTime``.
    The simulation will output if the wall time after the next
    top-level timestep will exceed ``StopCPUTime``, assuming that the wall
    time elapsed during a top-level timestep the same as the previous
    timestep. In units of seconds. Default: 2.592e6 (30 days)
``ResubmitOn`` (external)
    If set to 1, the simulation will stop if the wall time will exceed
    ``StopCPUTime`` within the next top-level timestep and run a shell
    script defined in ``ResubmitCommand`` that should resubmit the job
    for the user. Default: 0.
``ResubmitCommand`` (external)
    Filename of a shell script that creates a queuing (e.g. PBS)
    script from two arguments, the number of processors and parameter
    file.  This script is run by the root processor when stopping with
    ``ResubmitOn``. An example script can be found in
    input/resubmit.sh. Default: (null)

.. _streaming_param:

Streaming Data Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``NewMovieLeftEdge``, ``NewMovieRightEdge`` (external)
    These two parameters control the region for which the streaming
    data are written. Default: ``DomainLeftEdge`` and ``DomainRightEdge``.
``MovieSkipTimestep`` (external)
    Controls how many timesteps on a level are skipped between outputs
    in the streaming data. Streaming format is off if this equals
    ``INT_UNDEFINED``. Default: ``INT_UNDEFINED``
``Movie3DVolume`` (external)
    Set to 1 to write streaming data as 3-D arrays. This should always
    be set to 1 if using the streaming format. A previous version had
    2D maximum intensity projections, which now defunct. Default: 0.
``MovieVertexCentered`` (external)
    Set to 1 to write the streaming data interpolated to vertices. Set
    to 0 for cell-centered data. Default: 0.
``NewMovieDumpNumber`` (internal)
    Counter for streaming data files. This should equal the cycle
    number.
``MovieTimestepCounter`` (internal)
    Timestep counter for the streaming data files.
``MovieDataField`` (external)
    A maximum of 6 data fields can be written in the streaming format.
    The data fields are specified by the array element of
    BaryonField, i.e. 0 = Density, 7 = HII
    Density. For writing temperature, a special value of 1000 is used.
    This should be improved to be more transparent in which fields will
    be written. Any element that equals ``INT_UNDEFINED`` indicates no
    field will be written. Default: ``INT_UNDEFINED`` x 6
``NewMovieParticleOn`` (external)
    Set to 1 to write all particles in the grids. Set to 2 to write
    ONLY particles that aren't dark matter, e.g. stars. Set to 3/4 to
    write ONLY particles that aren't dark matter into a file separate
    from the grid info. (For example, ``MoviePackParticle_P000.hdf5``,
    etc. will be the file name; this will be very helpful in speeding
    up the access to the star particle data, especially for the
    visualization or for the star particle. See ``AMRH5writer.C``) Set to 0
    for no particle output. Default: 0.

.. _simulation_identifiers_parameters:

Simulation Identifiers and UUIDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These parameters help to track, identify and group datasets. For reference,
`Universally Unique Identifiers
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier>`_ (UUIDs) are
opaque identifiers using random 128-bit numbers, with an extremely low chance
of collision. (See :ref:`SimulationNamesAndIdentifiers` for a longer
description of these parameters.)

``MetaDataIdentifier`` (external)
    This is a character string without spaces (specifically, something
    that can be picked by "%s"), that can be defined in a parameter
    file, and will be written out in every following output, if it is
    found.
``MetaDataSimulationUUID`` (internal)
    A UUID that will be written out in all of the following outputs.
    Like ``MetaDataIdentifier``, an existing UUID will be kept, but if one
    is not found, and new one will be generated.
``MetaDataDatasetUUID`` (internal)
    A UUID created for each specific output.
``MetaDataRestartDatasetUUID`` (internal)
    If a ``MetaDataDatasetUUID`` UUID is found when the parameter file is
    read in, it will written to the following datasets. This is used to
    track simulations across restarts and parameter adjustments.
``MetaDataInitialConditionsUUID`` (internal)
    This is similar to ``MetaDataRestartDatasetUUID``, except it's used to
    track which initial conditions were used.

.. _hierarchy_control_parameters:

Hierarchy Control Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``StaticHierarchy`` (external)
    A flag which indicates if the hierarchy is static (1) or dynamic
    (0). In other words, a value of 1 takes the A out of AMR. Default:
    1
``RefineBy`` (external)
    This is the refinement factor between a grid and its subgrid. For
    cosmology simulations, we have found a ratio of 2 to be most useful.
    Default: 4
``MaximumRefinementLevel`` (external)
    This is the lowest (most refined) depth that the code will produce.
    It is zero based, so the total number of levels (including the root
    grid) is one more than this value. Default: 2
``CellFlaggingMethod`` (external)
    The method(s) used to specify when a cell should be refined. This
    is a list of integers, up to 9, as described by the following
    table. The methods combine in an "OR" fashion: if any of them
    indicate that a cell should be refined, then it is flagged. For
    cosmology simulations, methods 2 and 4 are probably most useful.
    Note that some methods have additional parameters which are
    described below. For more information about specific methods, see the
    method paper. Default: 1

    100                Avoid refinement based on ForbiddenRefinement field
    101                Avoid refinement in regions defined in "AvoidRefineRegion"
    ================== ==========================================================

``RefineRegionLeftEdge``, ``RefineRegionRightEdge`` (external)
    These two parameters control the region in which refinement is
    permitted. Each is a vector of floats (of length given by the
    problem rank) and they specify the two corners of a volume.
    Default: set equal to ``DomainLeftEdge`` and ``DomainRightEdge``.
``RefineRegionAutoAdjust`` (external)
    This is useful for multiresolution simulations with particles in
    which the particles have varying mass. Set to 1 to automatically
    adjust the refine region at root grid timesteps to only contain
    high-resolution particles. This makes sure that the fine regions do
    not contain more massive particles which may lead to small
    particles orbiting them or other undesired outcomes. Setting to any
    integer (for example, 3) will make AdjustRefineRegion to work at
    (RefineRegionAutoAdjust-1)th level timesteps because sometimes the
    heavy particles are coming into the fine regions too fast that you
    need more frequent protection. Default: 0.
``RefineRegionTimeType`` (external)
    If set, this controls how the first column of a refinement region
    evolution file (see below) is interpreted, 0 for code time, 1 for
    redshift. Default: -1, which is equivalent to 'off'.
``RefineRegionFile`` (external)
    The name of a text file containing the corners of the time-evolving
    refinement region. The lines in the file change the values of
    ``RefineRegionLeft/RightEdge`` during the course of the simulation, and
    the lines are ordered in the file from early times to late times.
    The first column of data is the time index (in code units or
    redshift, see the parameter above) for the next six columns, which
    are the values of ``RefineRegionLeft/RightEdge``. For example, this
    might be two lines from the text file when time is indexed by
    redshift:
    ::

        0.60 0.530 0.612 0.185 0.591 0.667 0.208
        0.55 0.520 0.607 0.181 0.584 0.653 0.201

    In this case, the refinement region stays at the z=0.60 value
    until z=0.55, when the box moves slightly closer to the (0,0,0)
    corner. There is a maximum of 300 lines in the file and there is no
    comment header line. Default: None.
``MinimumOverDensityForRefinement`` (external)
    These float values (up to 9) are used if the
    ``CellFlaggingMethod`` is 2, 4 or 5. For method 2 and 4, the value is the density (baryon or particle), in code units, above which refinement occurs. When using method 5, it becomes rho [code] - 1. The elements in this array must match those in ``CellFlaggingMethod``. Therefore, if ``CellFlaggingMethod`` = 1 4 9 10, ``MinimumOverDensityForRefinement`` = 0 8.0 0 0.

    In practice, this value is converted into a mass by
    multiplying it by the volume of the top grid cell. The result is
    then stored in the next parameter (unless that is set directly in
    which case this parameter is ignored), and this defines the mass
    resolution of the simulation. Note that the volume is of a top grid
    cell, so if you are doing a multi-grid initialization, you must
    divide this number by r\ :sup:`(d\*l)`\  where r is the refinement
    factor, d is the dimensionality and l is the (zero-based) lowest
    level. For example, for a two grid cosmology setup where a cell should be
    refined whenever the mass exceeds 4 times the mean density of the
    subgrid, this value should be 4 / (2\ :sup:`(3\*1)`\ ) = 4 / 8 =
    0.5. Keep in mind that this parameter has no effect if it is
    changed in a restart output; if you want to change the refinement
    mid-run you will have to modify the next parameter. Up to 9
    numbers may be specified here, each corresponding to the respective
    ``CellFlaggingMethod``. Default: 1.5
``MinimumMassForRefinement`` (internal)
    This float is usually set by the parameter above and so is labeled
    internal, but it can be set by hand. For non-cosmological simulations, it can be the easier refinement criteria to specify. It is the mass above
    which a refinement occurs if the ``CellFlaggingMethod`` is
    appropriately set. For cosmological simulations, it is specified in units such
    that the entire mass in the computational volume is 1.0, otherwise it is in code units. There are 9 numbers here again, as per the
    above parameter. Default: none
``MinimumMassForRefinementLevelExponent`` (external).
    This parameter modifies the behaviour of the above parameter. As it
    stands, the refinement based on the ``MinimumMassForRefinement``
    (hereafter Mmin) parameter is complete Lagrangian. However, this
    can be modified. The actual mass used is
    Mmin\*r\ :sup:`(l\*alpha)`\  where r is the refinement factor, l is
    the level and alpha is the value of this parameter
    (``MinimumMassForRefinementLevelExponent``). Therefore a negative value
    makes the refinement super-Lagrangian, while positive values are
    sub-Lagrangian. There are up to 9 values specified here, as per
    the above two parameters. Default: 0.0
``SlopeFlaggingFields`` (external)
    If ``CellFlaggingMethod`` is 1, and you only want to refine on the
    slopes of certain fields then you can enter the
    :ref:`Field Type IDs <Field_List_Reference>` of the fields you want,
    separating the IDs with a space. Up to 7 Field Type IDs can be
    specified. Default: Refine on slopes of all fields.
``MinimumSlopeForRefinement`` (external)
    If ``CellFlaggingMethod`` is 1, then local gradients are used as the
    refinement criteria. All variables are examined and the relative
    slope is computed: abs(q(i+1)-q(i-1))/q(i). Where this value
    exceeds this parameter, the cell is marked for refinement. This
    causes problems if q(i) is near zero. This is a single integer (as
    opposed to the list of five for the above parameters). Entering
    multiple numbers here correspond to the fields listed in
    ``SlopeFlaggingFields``. Default: 0.3
``MinimumPressureJumpForRefinement`` (external)
    If refinement is done by shocks, then this is the minimum
    (relative) pressure jump in one-dimension to qualify for a shock.
    The definition is rather standard (see Colella and Woodward's PPM
    paper for example) Default: 0.33
``MinimumEnergyRatioForRefinement`` (external)
    For the dual energy formalism, and cell flagging by
    shock-detection, this is an extra filter which removes weak shocks
    (or noise in the dual energy fields) from triggering the shock
    detection. Default: 0.1
``MinimumShearForRefinement`` (external)
    It is the minimum shear above which a refinement occurs if the CellFlaggingMethod is appropriately set. Default: 0
``OldShearMethod`` (external)
    If using the shear refinement criterion, setting this variable to 1 enables
    the old method for calculating the shear criterion, which actually
    calculates it based on shear and vorticity and makes some assumptions
    about the simulations (c_s=1, etc.).  However, this is necessary
    if you want to reproduce some of the old enzo results
    (e.g. Kritsuk et al. 2006).  Default: 0
``MetallicityRefinementMinMetallicity`` (external)
    For method 13 (metallicity refinement), this is the threshold
    metallicity (in units of solar metallicity) above which cells must
    be refined to a minimum level of
    ``MetallicityRefinementMinLevel``.  For method 19 (metal mass),
    this flags cells for refinement when the metal mass is above the
    necessary baryon mass (method 2) for refinement multiplied by this
    parameter.  Behaves similarly to refinement by baryon mass but
    focuses on metal-enriched regions.  In units of solar metallicity.
    Default: 1.0e-5
``MetallicityRefinementMinLevel`` (external)
    Sets the minimum level (maximum cell size) to which a cell enriched
    with metal above a level set by ``MetallicityRefinementMinMetallicity``
    will be refined. This can be set to any level up to and including
    ``MaximumRefinementLevel``. (No default setting)
``MetallicityRefinementMinDensity`` (external)
    It is the minimum density above which a refinement occurs when the cells are refined on metallicity.  Default: FLOAT_UNDEFINED
``ShockwaveRefinementMinMach`` (external)
    The minimum Mach number required to refine a level when using ShockwaveRefinement. Default: 1.3
``ShockwaveRefinementMinVelocity`` (external)
    The minimum shock velocity required to refine a level when using ShockwaveRefinement. Default: 1.0e7 (cm/s)
``ShockwaveRefinementMaxLevel`` (external)
    The maximum level to refine to using the ShockwaveRefinement criteria. Default: 0 (not used)
``SecondDerivativeFlaggingFields`` (external)
    The field indices (list of up to 7) that are used for the normalized second
    derivative refinement criteria. Default: INT_UNDEFINED
``MinimumSecondDerivativeForRefinement`` (external)
    The value of the second derivative above which a cell will be flagged for
    refinement. Each value in this list (of up to 7 values) should be between
    0.0 and 1.0.  Values between 0.3-0.8 are recommended.  Default: 0.3
``SecondDerivativeEpsilon`` (external)
    Used to avoid refining around oscillations/fluctuations in the normalized
    second derivative refinement method.  The higher the value, the more it
    will filter out.  For fluid instability simulations, a value of ~0.01 is
    good.  For full-physics simulations, values around ~0.2 are recommended. Be
    aware that fluctuations on this scale in initial conditions may cause
    immediate refinement to the maximum level.  Default: 1.0e-2
``RefineByJeansLengthSafetyFactor`` (external)
    If the Jeans length refinement criterion (see ``CellFlaggingMethod``)
    is being used, then this parameter specifies the number of cells
    which must cover one Jeans length. Default: 4
``JeansRefinementColdTemperature`` (external)
    If the Jeans length refinement criterion (see ``CellFlaggingMethod``)
    is being used, and this parameter is greater than zero, this
    temperature will be used in all cells when calculating the Jeans
    length.  If it is less than or equal to zero, it will be used as a
    temperature floor when calculating the Jeans length. Default: -1.0
``RefineByResistiveLengthSafetyFactor`` (external)
    Resistive length is defined as the curl of the magnetic field over
    the magnitude of the magnetic field. We make sure this length is
    covered by this number of cells. i.w. The resistive length in a MHD simulation should not be smaller than CellWidth * RefineByResistiveLengthSafetyFactor.  Default: 2.0
``MustRefineParticlesCreateParticles`` (external)
    This parameter will flag dark matter particles in cosmological
    initial conditions as ``MustRefineParticles``.  If ``CellFlaggingMethod``
    8 is set, AMR will be restricted to cells surrounding
    ``MustRefineParticles``.  There are several different modes for creating
    ``MustRefineParticles`` with this parameter described below.  Further
    information on how to use dark matter ``MustRefineParticles`` in
    cosmological simulations can be found here (link).  Default: 0

    1. If the user specifies ``MustRefineParticlesLeftEdge`` and
       ``MustRefineParticlesRightEdge``, dark matter particles within the
       specified region are flagged.  Otherwise, the code looks for an ascii
       input file called MustRefineParticlesFlaggingList.in that contains a list
       of particle ids to be flagged.  The ids in this list must be sorted in
       ascending order.
    2. For use with ellipsoidal masking in MUSIC initial conditions.  This
       setting uses traditional static grids for intermediate resolution levels
       MUSIC will generate RefinementMask files and the ``ParticleTypeName``
       parameter should be set to the name of these files.
    3. Same as setting 2, except refinement on intermediate levels is not
       constrained by static grids.  Instead, refinement around dark matter
       particles is allowed down to the level of a particle's generation level.
       Refinement beyond this level is allowed around particles within the MUSIC
       ellipsoidal masking region.  Note, dark matter particles corresponding to
       a generation level N are guaranteed to be refined to at least level N, but
       may also exist on levels N > 1 if in the vicinity of an N > 1 dark matter
       particle or a tagged must-refine particle.
    4. Similar to setting 3, except dark matter particles corresponding to a
       generation level N are refined only to level N and no further. If two
       dark matter particles from different levels occupy the same cell, that
       cell will be refined to the coarser level. Tagged must-refine particles
       near coarse dark matter particles will be similarly de-refined. Compared
       to option 3, this can be used to prevent unnecessary mesh refinement in
       regions where coarser particles enter into higher resolution regions,
       slowing down the simulation. Note, with this setting, coarse boundary
       particles entering into a high resolution region will eventually lead
       to total derefinement of the region of interest.


``MustRefineParticlesRefineToLevel`` (external)
    The maximum level on which ``MustRefineParticles`` are required to
    refine to. Currently sink particles and MBH particles are required
    to be sitting at this level at all times. Default: 0
``MustRefineParticlesRefineToLevelAutoAdjust`` (external)
    The parameter above might not be handy in cosmological simulations
    if you want your ``MustRefineParticles`` to be refined to a certain
    physical length, not to a level whose cell size keeps changing.
    This parameter (positive integer in pc) allows you to do just that.
    For example, if you set ``MustRefineParticlesRefineToLevelAutoAdjust``
    = 128 (pc), then the code will automatically calculate
    ``MustRefineParticlesRefineToLevel`` using the boxsize and redshift
    information. Default: 0 (FALSE)
``MustRefineParticlesMinimumMass`` (external)
    This was an experimental parameter to set a minimum for ``MustRefineParticles``. Default: 0.0
``MustRefineParticlesRegionLeftEdge`` (external)
    Bottom-left corner of a region in which dark matter particles are flagged
    as ``MustRefineParticles`` in nested cosmological simulations.  To be used with
    ``MustRefineParticlesCreateParticles`` = 1.  Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0
``MustRefineParticlesRegionRightEdge`` (external)
    Top-right corner of a region in which dark matter particles are flagged
    as ``MustRefineParticles`` in nested cosmological simulations.  To be used with
    ``MustRefineParticlesCreateParticles`` = 1.  Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0
``MustRefineRegionMinRefinementLevel`` (external)
    Minimum level to which the rectangular solid volume defined by
    ``MustRefineRegionLeftEdge`` and ``MustRefineRegionRightEdge`` will be
    refined to at all times. (No default setting)
``MustRefineRegionLeftEdge`` (external)
    Bottom-left corner of refinement region. Must be within the overall
    refinement region. If using a moving refinement region, this will
    correspond to the bottom-left corner in the
    ``MustRefineRegionFile``
    at this output time. If these parameters are not set, then the code will
    likely try to refine the entire domain to the forced refinement level before
    only doing it within the MustRefineRegion, which can take a long
    time.  Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0
``MustRefineRegionRightEdge`` (external)
    Top-right corner of refinement region. Must be within the overall
    refinement region.  If using a moving refinement region, this will
    correspond to the top-right corner in the
    ``MustRefineRegionFile`` at this output time. If these parameters are not set, then the code will likely try to
    refine the entire domain to the forced refinement level before
    only doing it within the MustRefineRegion, which can take a long
    time.  Default: 1.0 1.0 1.0
``MustRefineRegionTimeType`` (external)
    If set, this controls how the first column of a ``MustRefineRegionFile`` (see below) is interpreted, 0 for code time, 1 for redshift. Default: -1, which is equivalent to ‘off’.
``MustRefineRegionFile`` (external)
    The name of a text file containing the corners of the time-evolving
    refinement region. The lines in the file change the values of
    ``MustRefineRegionLeft/RightEdge`` during the course of the simulation, and
    the lines are ordered in the file from early times to late times.
    The first column of data is the time index (in code units or
    redshift, see the parameter above) for the next six columns, which
    are the values of ``MustRefineRegionLeft/RightEdge``, followed by
    a column giving the level of refinement. For example, this
    might be two lines from the text file when time is indexed by
    redshift:
    ::

        2.05 0.493102 0.488106 0.501109 0.495102 0.490106 0.503109 10
	2.00 0.493039 0.487908 0.501189 0.495039 0.489908 0.503189 10

    In this case, the MustRefineRegion is refined to 10 levels of
    refinement, starting at the z=2.05 value and
    moves via linear interpolation until the z=2.00 value. The code
    will crash if the simulation starts before the earliest time given
    or evolves until after the latest time in the file. There is a maximum of 8000 lines in the file and there is no
    comment header line. Default: None.
``UseCoolingRefineRegion`` (external)
    1 if using a CoolingRefineRegion; 0 if not. If this is set, then the
    CoolingRefineRegion is a rectilinear region in which refinement
    can be based on the cooling time  (``CellFlaggingMethod`` 7 must be
    set) but refinement based on the cooling time will not occur
    outside of this region. Default: 0
``EvolveCoolingRefineRegion`` (external)
    1 if the CoolingRefineRegion is evolving; 0 if not. Default: 0
``CoolingRefineRegionLeftEdge`` (external)
    Bottom-left corner of refinement region. Must be within the overall
    refinement region.  If using a moving refinement region, this will
    correspond to the bottom-left corner in the
    ``CoolingRefineRegionFile`` at this output time. If these parameters are not set, then the code will likely try to
    refine the entire domain to the forced refinement level before
    only doing it within the CoolingRefineRegion, which can take a long
    time.  Default: 0.0 0.0 0.0
``CoolingRefineRegionRightEdge`` (external)
    Top-right corner of refinement region. Must be within the overall
    refinement region.  If using a moving refinement region, this will
    correspond to the top-right corner in the
    ``CoolingRefineRegionFile`` at this output time. If these parameters are not set, then the code will likely try to
    refine the entire domain to the forced refinement level before
    only doing it within the CoolingRefineRegion, which can take a long
    time.  Default: 1.0 1.0 1.0
``CoolingRefineRegionTimeType`` (external)
    If set, this controls how the first column of a ``CoolingRefineRegionFile`` (see below) is interpreted, 0 for code time, 1 for redshift. Default: -1, which is equivalent to ‘off’.
``CoolingRefineRegionFile`` (external)
    The name of a text file containing the corners of the time-evolving cooling refinement region. The file format is the same as for a
    ``MustRefineRegionFile``, but though the final column (refinement level) must be included, it is currently ignored by the code and
    the cooling refinement level is instead set to the ``MaximumRefinementLevel``. Default: None.
``StaticRefineRegionLevel[#]`` (external)
    This parameter is used to specify regions of the problem that are
    to be statically refined, regardless of other parameters. This is mostly
    used as an internal mechanism to keep the initial grid hierarchy in
    place, but can be specified by the user. Up to 20 static regions
    may be defined (this number set in ``macros_and_parameters.h``), and
    each static region is labeled starting from zero. For each static
    refined region, two pieces of information are required: (1) the
    region (see the next two parameters), and (2) the level at which
    the refinement is to occurs (0 implies a level 1 region will always
    exist). Default: none
``StaticRefineRegionLeftEdge[#]``, ``StaticRefineRegionRightEdge[#]`` (external)
    These two parameters specify the two corners of a statically
    refined region (see the previous parameter). Default: none
``AvoidRefineRegionLevel[#]`` (external)
    This parameter is used to limit the refinement to this level in a
    rectangular region.  Up to MAX_STATIC_REGIONS regions can be used.
    Default: IND_UNDEFINED
``AvoidRefineRegionLeftEdge[#]``, ``AvoidRefineRegionRightEdge[#]`` (external)
    These two parameters specify the two corners of a region that
    limits refinement to a certain level (see the previous
    parameter). Default: none
``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#]`` (external)
    This parameter (and the ones following) describe a physical region of the simulation box for which an
    independent refinement maximum and minimum (separate from ``MaximumRefinementLevel``) can be specified.
``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#]`` controls the geometry of the refined volume. Currently implemented
    geometries are: (0) a rectangular region, (1) a ring of infinite height and (2) a cylinder of infinite
    height. Up to 20 multi-refined regions may be defined (number the same as for ``StaticRefineRegion``)
    and each multi-refined region is labelled starting from zero. Default: -1 (no multi-regions)
``MultiRefineRegionLeftEdge[#]``, ``MultiRefineRegionRightEdge[#]`` (external)
    Used when ``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#] = 0`` and specifies the two corners in code units of a
    rectangular multi-region with a given maximum and minimum refinement level. Default: none.
``MultiRefineRegionCenter[#]`` (external)
    Used when ``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#] = 1 or 2`` and specifies the center of the ring or cylinder
    in code units. Default: none
``MultiRefineRegionRadius[#]`` (external)
    Used when ``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#] = 1 or 2`` and specifies the radius of the ring or cylinder
    in code units. In the case of the ring, this marks the distance to the middle of the ring's thickness.
    The thickness is specified with ``MultiRefineRegionWidth``. Default: none
``MultiRefineRegionWidth[#]`` (external)
    Used when ``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#] = 1`` and specifies the width (thickness) of the ring in
    code units. Default: none
``MultiRefineRegionOrientation[#]`` (external)
    Used when ``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#] = 1 or 2`` and is a unit vector pointing along the vertical
    direction of the ring or cylinder. Default: none.
``MultiRefineRegionStaggeredRefinement[#]`` (external)
    Used when ``MultiRefineRegionGeometry[#] = 1 or 2``. To avoid a sharp change in refinement at the edge of
    the ring or cylinder, the allowed refinement is staggered from the maximum allowed value outside the
    region, ``MultiRefineRegionOuterMaximumLevel``, to the maximum allowed refinement inside the region,
    ``MultiRefineRegionMaximumLevel``. This parameter is the length over which that staggering occurs in
    code units. Default: 0.0 (no staggering)
``MultiRefineRegionMaximumLevel[#]``, ``MultiRefineRegionMinimumLevel[#]`` (external)
    Maximum and minimum allowed refinement inside the region. Default: ``MaximumRefinementLevel``, 0
``MultiRefineRegionMaximumOuterLevel``, ``MultiRefineRegionMinimumOuterLevel`` (external)
    Maximum and minimum allowed refinement outside all regions. Default: ``MaximumRefinementLevel``, 0
``MinimumEfficiency`` (external)
    When new grids are created during the rebuilding process, each grid
    is split up by a recursive bisection process that continues until a
    subgrid is either of a minimum size or has an efficiency higher
    than this value. The efficiency is the ratio of flagged zones
    (those requiring refinement) to the total number of zones in the
    grid. This is a number between 0 and 1 and should probably by
    around 0.4 for standard three-dimensional runs. Default: 0.2
``NumberOfBufferZones`` (external)
    Each flagged cell, during the regridding process, is surrounded by
    a number of zones to prevent the phenomenon of interest from
    leaving the refined region before the next regrid. This integer
    parameter controls the number required, which should almost always
    be one. Default: 1
``MinimumSubgridEdge`` (external)
    The minimum length of the edge of a subgrid.  See :ref:`running_large_simulations`. Default: 6
``MaximumSubgridSize`` (external)
    The maximum size (volume) of a subgrid.  See :ref:`running_large_simulations`. Default: 32768
``CriticalGridRatio`` (external)
    Critical grid ratio above which subgrids will be split in half along their
    long axis prior to being split by the second derivative of their
    signature.  Default: 3.0
``SubgridSizeAutoAdjust`` (external)
    See :ref:`running_large_simulations`.  Default: 1 (TRUE)
``OptimalSubgridsPerProcessor`` (external)
    See :ref:`running_large_simulations`.  Default: 16
``LoadBalancing`` (external)
    Set to 0 to keep child grids on the same processor as their
    parents. Set to 1 to balance the work on one level over all
    processors. Set to 2 or 3 to load balance the grids but keep them
    on the same node. Option 2 assumes grouped scheduling, i.e. proc #
    = (01234567) reside on node (00112233) if there are 4 nodes. Option
    3 assumes round-robin scheduling (proc = (01234567) -> node =
    (01230123)). Set to 4 for load balancing along a Hilbert
    space-filling curve on each level. See :ref:`running_large_simulations`. Default: 1
``LoadBalancingCycleSkip`` (external)
    This sets how many cycles pass before we load balance the root
    grids. Only works with LoadBalancing set to 2 or 3. NOT RECOMMENDED
    for nested grid calculations. Default: 10
``LoadBalancingMinLevel`` (external)
    Load balance the grids in levels greater than this parameter.  Default: 0
``LoadBalancingMaxLevel`` (external)
    Load balance the grids in levels less than this parameter.  Default: MAX_DEPTH_OF_HIERARCHY
``ResetLoadBalancing`` (external)
    When restarting a simulation, this parameter resets the processor number of each root grid to be sequential.  All child grids are assigned to the processor of their parent grid.  Only implemented for LoadBalancing = 1.  Default = 0
``NumberOfRootGridTilesPerDimensionPerProcessor`` (external)
    Splits the root grid into 2^(dimensions*this parameter) grids per MPI process.  Default: 1
``UserDefinedRootGridLayout`` (external)
   A three element array.  Splits the root grid into ``N`` subgrids where ``N``
   is the product of the supplied values.  The first entry corresponds to the
   number of root grid decompositions along the x axis of the simulation, the
   second element the number of decompositions along the y axis, and the third
   the number of decompositions along the z axis.

   This parameter is only used if all three elements of the array are set to a
   value different from the dummy default value.  If that is the case the root
   grid will be *manually* decomposed and the value supplied for
   ``NumberOfRootGridTilesPerDimensionPerProcessor`` will be ignored.  This is
   most useful when an automatic root grid decomposition is inefficient (for
   example, in a deeply nested isolated galaxy simulation).

   This parameter should be used with caution since it is possible to get into
   a situation where there are fewer grids than CPU cores.  Normally this can
   never happen since there will always be at least one root grid tile for every
   CPU.  Most simulations assume you will be running with as many root grid
   tiles as CPUs - if you instead opt to reduce the number of root grid tiles
   per CPU to a number less than one, Enzo might break in unpredictable ways.
   Default: -99999 -99999 -99999

``FastSiblingLocatorEntireDomain`` (external)
    In zoom-in calculations, the fast sibling locator doesn't need to search the entire domain.  Turning this parameter on restricts the finder to the inner nested grid.  Currently broken.  Default: 0
``MoveParticlesBetweenSiblings`` (external)
    During RebuildHierarchy, particles that have moved beyond the grid boundaries are moved to the correct grid.  Default: 1
``RebuildHierarchyCycleSkip`` (external)
    Set the number of cycles at a given level before rebuilding the hierarchy.  Example: RebuildHierarchyCycleSkip[1] = 4




.. _gravity_parameters:

Gravity Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _general_gravity_parameters:

General Gravity Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``TopGridGravityBoundary`` (external)
    A single integer which specified the type of gravitational boundary
    conditions for the top grid. Possible values are 0 for periodic and
    1 for isolated (for all dimensions). The isolated boundary
    conditions have not been tested recently, so caveat emptor.
    Default: 0
``SelfGravity`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) indicates if the baryons and particles
    undergo self-gravity.
``SelfGravityGasOff`` (external)
    This parameter is used in conjunction with SelfGravity so that only particles contribute to potential, not gas. Default = False (i.e. gas does contribute)
``GravitySolverType`` (external)
    Gravity solver to use (0: Multigrid, 1: APM).
    Default: 0
``GravitationalConstant`` (external)
    This is the gravitational constant to be used in code units. For cgs units it
    should be 4\*pi\*G. For cosmology, this value must be 1 for the
    standard units to hold. A more detailed description can be found at :ref:`EnzoInternalUnits`. Default: 4\*pi.
``PotentialIterations`` (external)
    Number of iterations to solve the potential on the subgrids. Values
    less than 4 sometimes will result in slight overdensities on grid
    boundaries. Default: 4.
``MaximumGravityRefinementLevel`` (external)
    This is the lowest (most refined) depth that a gravitational
    acceleration field is computed. More refined levels interpolate
    from this level, providing a mechanism for instituting a minimum
    gravitational smoothing length. Default: ``MaximumRefinementLevel``
``MaximumParticleRefinementLevel`` (external)
    This is the level at which the dark matter particle contribution to
    the gravity is smoothed. This works in an inefficient way (it
    actually smoothes the particle density onto the grid), and so is
    only intended for highly refined regions which are nearly
    completely baryon dominated. It is used to remove the discreteness
    effects of the few remaining dark matter particles. Not used if set
    to a value less than 0. Default: -1
``ParticleSubgridDepositMode`` (external)
    This parameter controls how particles stored in subgrid are deposited
    into the current grid.  Options are:

     0. (CIC_DEPOSIT) - This is a second-order, cloud-in-cell deposition
         method in which the cloud size is equal to the cell size in
         the target grid (particles are in source grid, deposited into
         target grid).  This method preserves the correct center-of-mass
         for a single particle but smears out boundaries and can result
         in small artifacts for smooth particle distributions (e.g.
         nested cosmological simulations with low perturbations).
     1. (CIC_DEPOSIT_SMALL) - This is also a CIC method, but the cloud
         size is taken to be the cell size in the source grid, so for
         subgrids, the cloud is smaller than the grid size.  This
         is an attempt to compromise between the other two methods.
     2. (NGP_DEPOSIT) - This uses a first order, nearest-grid-point
        method to deposit particle mass.  It does not preserve center-
        of mass position and so for single particle results in noisy
        accelerations.  However, it does correctly treat nested
        cosmology simulations with low initial perturbations.

    Default: 1
``BaryonSelfGravityApproximation`` (external)
    This flag indicates if baryon density is derived in a strange,
    expensive but self-consistent way (0 - off), or by a completely
    reasonable and much faster approximation (1 - on). This is an
    experiment gone wrong; leave on. Well, actually, it's important for
    very dense structures as when radiative cooling is turned on, so
    set to 0 if using many levels and radiative cooling is on [ignored
    in current version]. Default: 1

.. _apm_gravity_parameters:

APM Gravity Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``DepositAlsoParentGridAndSiblingsParticles`` (external)
    Deposit particles also from the parent grid and the siblings.
    This solves issues arising when particles are close to the grid edges.
    Default: 0

``TimeSteppingRefinementCondition`` (external)
    Additional condition constraining the time step on level *l+1* to be smaller
    that the timestep on level *l* divided by the refinenemt factor.
    Default: 0

``APMAddParentContribution`` (external)
    Add the parent contribution to potential/acceleration onto the grid.
    **Never turn this off except for testing/debugging**.
    Default: TRUE

``S2ParticleSize`` (external)
    Size of the sphere (in cell size) used to filter the contribution of the
    smallest scales to the gravitational force.
    Default: 3.0

.. _external_gravity_source:

External Gravity Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These parameters set up an external static background gravity source that is
added to the acceleration field for the baryons and particles.

``PointSourceGravity`` (external)
    This parameter indicates that there is to be a
    (constant) gravitational field with a point source profile (``PointSourceGravity`` =
    1) or NFW profile (``PointSourceGravity`` = 2). Default: 0
``PointSourceGravityConstant`` (external)
    If ``PointSourceGravity`` = 1, this is the magnitude of the point
    source acceleration at a distance of 1
    length unit (i.e. GM in code units). If ``PointSourceGravity`` =
    2, then it takes the mass of the dark matter halo in CGS
    units. ``ProblemType`` = 31 (galaxy disk simulation) automatically calculates
    values for ``PointSourceGravityConstant`` and
    ``PointSourceGravityCoreRadius``. ``ProblemType`` = 108 (elliptical galaxy and galaxy cluster) also includes the gravity from the stellar component and the SMBH. Default: 1
``PointSourceGravityCoreRadius`` (external)
    For ``PointSourceGravity`` = 1, this is the radius inside which
    the acceleration field is smoothed in code units. With ``PointSourceGravity`` =
    2, it is the scale radius, rs, in CGS units (see Navarro, Frank & White,
    1997). Default: 0
``PointSourceGravityPosition`` (external)
    If the ``PointSourceGravity`` flag is turned on, this parameter
    specifies the center of the point-source gravitational field in
    code units. Default: 0 0 0
``ExternalGravity`` (external)
   This fulfills the same purpose as ``PointSourceGravity`` but is
   more aptly named. ``ExternalGravity = 1`` turns on an alternative
   implementation of the NFW profile with properties
   defined via the parameters ``HaloCentralDensity``, ``HaloConcentration`` and ``HaloVirialRadius``. Boxsize is assumed to be 1.0 in this case. ``ExternalGravity = 10`` gives a gravitational field defined by the logarithmic potential in Binney & Tremaine, corresponding to a disk with constant circular velocity.  Default: 0
``ExternalGravityConstant`` (external)
    If ``ExternalGravity = 10``, this is the circular velocity of the disk in code units. Default: 0.0
``ExternalGravityDensity``
   Reserved for future use.
``ExternalGravityPosition`` (external)
    If ``ExternalGravity = 10``, this parameter specifies the center of the gravitational field in code units. Default: 0 0 0
``ExternalGravityOrientation`` (external)
    For ``ExternalGravity = 10``, this is the unit vector of the disk's angular momentum (e.g. a disk whose face-on view is oriented in the x-y plane would have ``ExternalGravityOrientation = 0 0 1``). Default: 0 0 0
``ExternalGravityRadius`` (external)
   If ``ExternalGravity = 10``, this marks the inner radius of the disk in code units within which the velocity drops to zero. Default: 0.0
``UniformGravity`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) indicates if there is to be a uniform
    gravitational field. Default: 0
``UniformGravityDirection`` (external)
    This integer is the direction of the uniform gravitational field: 0
    - along the x axis, 1 - y axis, 2 - z axis. Default: 0
``UniformGravityConstant`` (external)
    Magnitude (and sign) of the uniform gravitational acceleration.
    Default: 1
``DiskGravity`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) indicates if there is to be a
    disk-like gravity field (Berkert 1995; Mori & Burkert 2000).  Default: 0
``DiskGravityPosition`` (external)
    This indicates the position of the center of the disk gravity.
    Default: 0 0 0
``DiskGravityAngularMomentum`` (external)
    Specifies the unit vector of the disk angular momentum.
    Default: 0 0 1
``DiskGravityStellarDiskMass`` (external)
    Total mass of stellar disk (in solar masses)
    Default: 1e11
``DiskGravityDiskScaleHeightR`` (external)
    Disk scale length in radius (in Mpc)
    Default: 4.0e-3
``DiskGravityDiskScaleHeightz`` (external)
    Disk scale height in z (in Mpc)
    Default: 2.5e-4
``DiskGravityStellarBulgeMass`` (external)
    Disk stellar bulge mass (in solar masses)
    Default: 1.0e10
``DiskGravityStellarBulgeR`` (external)
    Disk stellar bulge scalue radius (in Mpc)
    Default: 1.0e-4
``DiskGravityDarkMatterR`` (external)
    Dark matter halo scale radius (in Mpc)
    Default: 2.3e-2
``DiskGravityDarkMatterDensity`` (external)
    Dark matter effective density (in cgs)
    Default: 3.81323e-25

.. _general_hydrodynamics_parameters:

General Hydrodynamics Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``UseHydro`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) controls whether a hydro solver is used.
    Default: 1
``HydroMethod`` (external)
    This integer specifies the hydrodynamics method that will be used.
    Currently implemented are

    ============== =============================
    Hydro method   Description
    ============== =============================
    0              PPM DE (a direct-Eulerian version of PPM)
    1              [reserved]
    2              ZEUS (a Cartesian, 3D version of Stone & Norman). Note that if ZEUS is selected, it automatically turns off ``ConservativeInterpolation`` and the ``DualEnergyFormalism`` flags.
    3              Runge Kutta second-order based MUSCL solvers.
    4              Same as 3 but including Dedner MHD (Wang & Abel 2008). For 3 and 4 there are the additional parameters ``RiemannSolver`` and ``ReconstructionMethod`` you want to set.
    5              No Hydro (Testing only)
    6              MHD with Constrained Transport.
    ============== =============================

    Default: 0

    More details on each of the above methods can be found at :ref:`hydro_methods`.
``FluxCorrection`` (external)
    This flag indicates if the flux fix-up step should be carried out
    around the boundaries of the sub-grid to preserve conservation (0 -
    off, 1 - on, 2 - direct correction for color fields). Strictly speaking
    this should always be used, but we have found it to lead to a less
    accurate solution for cosmological simulations because of the relatively
    sharp density gradients involved. However, it does appear to be
    important when radiative cooling is turned on and very dense structures
    are created. It does work with the ZEUS hydro method, but since velocity
    is face-centered, momentum flux is not corrected. If FluxCorrection = 1,
    species quantities are not flux corrected directly but are modified to
    keep the fraction constant based on the density change. If FluxCorrection
    = 2, species quantities are flux corrected directly in the same way as
    density and energy. Default: 1
``InterpolationMethod`` (external)
    There should be a whole section devoted to the interpolation
    method, which is used to generate new sub-grids and to fill in the
    boundary zones of old sub-grids, but a brief summary must suffice.
    The possible values of this integer flag are shown in the table
    below. The names specify (in at least a rough sense) the order of
    the leading error term for a spatial Taylor expansion, as well as a
    letter for possible variants within that order. The basic problem
    is that you would like your interpolation method to be:
    multi-dimensional, accurate, monotonic and conservative. There
    doesn't appear to be much literature on this, so I've had to
    experiment. The first one (ThirdOrderA) is time-consuming and
    probably not all that accurate. The second one (SecondOrderA) is
    the workhorse: it's only problem is that it is not always
    symmetric. The next one (SecondOrderB) is a failed experiment, and
    SecondOrderC is not conservative. FirstOrderA is everything except
    for accurate. If HydroMethod = 2 (ZEUS), this flag is ignored, and
    the code automatically uses SecondOrderC for velocities and
    FirstOrderA for cell-centered quantities. Default: 1
    ::

              0 - ThirdOrderA     3 - SecondOrderC
              1 - SecondOrderA    4 - FirstOrderA
              2 - SecondOrderB

``ConservativeInterpolation`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) indicates if the interpolation should
    be done in the conserved quantities (e.g. momentum rather than
    velocity). Ideally, this should be done, but it can cause problems
    when strong density gradients occur. This must(!) be set off for
    ZEUS hydro (the code does it automatically). Default: 1
``RiemannSolver`` (external)
    This integer specifies the Riemann solver. Solver options, and the relevant
    hydro method, are summarized as follows:

    ================ =========== ===========================
    Riemann solver   HydroMethod Description
    ================ =========== ===========================
    0                --          [reserved]
    1                0,3,4       HLL (Harten-Lax-van Leer) a two-wave, three-state solver with no resolution of contact waves
    2                            [reserved]
    3                3,4         LLF (Local Lax-Friedrichs)
    4                0,3         HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer with Contact) a three-wave, four-state solver with better resolution of contacts
    5                0           TwoShock
    6                4,6         HLLD
    ================ =========== ===========================

    Default: 1 (HLL) for ``HydroMethod`` = 3; 5 (TwoShock) for
    ``HydroMethod`` = 0; 6 (HLLD) for ``HydroMethod = 6``
``RiemannSolverFallback`` (external; only if ``HydroMethod`` is 0, 3 or 4)
    If the euler update results in a negative density or energy, the
    solver will fallback to the HLL Riemann solver that is more
    diffusive only for the failing cell.  Only active when using the
    HLLC or TwoShock Riemann solver.  Default: OFF.
``ReconstructionMethod`` (external; only if ``HydroMethod`` is 3 or 4)
    This integer specifies the reconstruction method for the MUSCL solver. Choice of

    ===================== ============ ===================
    Reconstruction Method HydroMethod  Description
    ===================== ============ ===================
    0                     0,3,4,6      PLM (piecewise linear)
    1                     0            PPM (piecwise parabolic)
    2                                  [reserved]
    3                                  [reserved]
    4                                  [reserved]
    6                     6            MUSCL-Hancock (Non Runge-Kutta)
    ===================== ============ ===================

    Default: 0 (PLM) for ``HydroMethod`` = 3; 1 (PPM) for ``HydroMethod`` = 0
``ConservativeReconstruction`` (external; only if ``HydroMethod`` is 3 or 4)
    Experimental.  This option turns on the reconstruction of the
    left/right interfaces in the Riemann problem in the conserved
    variables (density, momentum, and energy) instead of the primitive
    variables (density, velocity, and pressure).  This generally gives
    better results in constant-mesh problems has been problematic in
    AMR simulations.  Default: OFF
``PositiveReconstruction`` (external; only if ``HydroMethod`` is 3 or 4)
    Experimental and not working.  This forces the Riemann solver to
    restrict the fluxes to always give positive pressure.  Attempts to
    use the Waagan (2009), JCP, 228, 8609 method.  Default: OFF
``Gamma`` (external)
    The ratio of specific heats for an ideal gas (used by all hydro
    methods). If using multiple species (i.e. ``MultiSpecies`` > 0), then
    this value is ignored in favor of a direct calculation (except for
    PPM LR) Default: 5/3.
``Mu`` (external)
    The molecular weight. Default: 0.6.
``CourantSafetyNumber`` (external)
    This is the maximum fraction of the CFL-implied timestep that will
    be used to advance any grid. A value greater than 1 is unstable
    (for all explicit methods). The recommended value is 0.4. Default:
    0.6.
``RootGridCourantSafetyNumber`` (external)
    This is the maximum fraction of the CFL-implied timestep that will
    be used to advance ONLY the root grid. When using simulations with
    star particle creation turned on, this should be set to a value of
    approximately 0.01-0.02 to keep star particles from flying all over
    the place. Otherwise, this does not need to be set, and in any case
    should never be set to a value greater than 1.0. Default: 1.0.
``UseCoolingTimestep`` (external)
    This parameter will limit the timestep on each level by some fraction
    of the minimum cooling time on the level, where this fraction is
    set by ``CoolingTimestepSafetyFactor``.  In most cases, this will
    substantially decrease the timesteps, depending on the local
    cooling time, and thus increase the run time of any
    simulation. Default: OFF
``CoolingTimestepSafetyFactor`` (external)
    Described in ``UseCoolingTime``.  Default: 0.1
``DualEnergyFormalism`` (external)
    The dual energy formalism is needed to make total energy schemes
    such as PPM DE and PPM LR stable and accurate in the
    "hyper-Machian" regime (i.e. where the ratio of thermal energy to
    total energy < ~0.001). Turn on for cosmology runs with PPM DE and
    PPM LR. Automatically turned off when used with the hydro method
    ZEUS. Integer flag (0 - off, 1 - on). When turned on, there are two
    energy fields: total energy and thermal energy. Default: 0
``DualEnergyFormalismEta1``, ``DualEnergyFormalismEta2`` (external)
    These two parameters are part of the dual energy formalism and
    should probably not be changed. Defaults: 0.001 and 0.1
    respectively.
``PressureFree`` (external)
    A flag that is interpreted by the PPM DE hydro method as an
    indicator that it should try and mimic a pressure-free fluid. A
    flag: 1 is on, 0 is off. Default: 0
``PPMFlatteningParameter`` (external)
    This is a PPM parameter to control noise for slowly-moving shocks.
    It is either on (1) or off (0). Default: 0
``PPMDiffusionParameter`` (external)
    This is the PPM diffusion parameter (see the Colella and Woodward
    method paper for more details). It is either on (1) or off (0).
    Default: 1 [Currently disabled (set to 0)]
``PPMSteepeningParameter`` (external)
    A PPM modification designed to sharpen contact discontinuities. It
    is either on (1) or off (0). Default: 0
``SmallRho`` (external)
    Minimum value for density in code units. This is enforced in euler.F
    when using the PPM solver (``HydroMethod`` = 0) or in
    hydro_rk/EvolveLevel_RK.C when ``HydroMethod`` is 3 or 4. Not enforced
    in other hydrodynamics methods. Default: 1e-30
``ZEUSQuadraticArtificialViscosity`` (external)
    This is the quadratic artificial viscosity parameter C2 of Stone &
    Norman, and corresponds (roughly) to the number of zones over which
    a shock is spread. Default: 2.0
``ZEUSLinearArtificialViscosity`` (external)
    This is the linear artificial viscosity parameter C1 of Stone &
    Norman. Default: 0.0

.. _minimum_pressure_support_parameters:

Minimum Pressure Support Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``UseMinimumPressureSupport`` (external)
    When radiative cooling is turned on, and objects are allowed to
    collapse to very small sizes so that their Jeans length is no
    longer resolved, then they may undergo artificial fragmentation
    and angular momentum non-conservation.  To alleviate this problem,
    as discussed in more detail in Machacek, Bryan & Abel (2001), a
    very simple fudge was introduced: if this flag is turned on, then
    a minimum temperature is applied to grids with level ==
    ``MaximumRefinementLevel``. This minimum temperature is that
    required to make each cell Jeans stable multiplied by the
    parameter below.  More precisely, the temperature of a cell is set
    such that the resulting Jeans length is the square-root of the
    parameter ``MinimumPressureSupportParameter``.  So, for the
    default value of 100 (see below), this insures that the ratio of
    the Jeans length/cell size is at least 10.  Default: 0
``MinimumPressureSupportParameter`` (external)
    This is the numerical parameter discussed above. Default: 100

.. _mhd_ct_parameters:

    2           Gardiner and Stone 2005. Second order Lax-Friedrichs type reconstruction.
                Uses ``CT_AthenaDissipation`` flag.
    3           Gardiner and Stone 2005.  Second order reconstruction using
                upwind switches
    ========== ==========================================================================

    Default: 3

``CT_AthenaDissipation``  (external)
    For the Lax-Friedrichs CT method, this is the maximum wave speed.  (:math:`\alpha` in Gardiner & Stone 2005 eqn. 46). Default: 0.1

``EquationOfState`` (external, ct only)
    0: standard adiabatic 1: Exactly isothermal
    equation of state.  This flag removes the total energy term completely, instead
    computing pressure as :math:`p = c^2 \rho`. This option only works with
    ``HydroMethod = 6`` and ``RiemannSolver = 6`` (HLLD) as this is the only purely
    isothermal Riemann solver in Enzo.  Default: 0

``IsothermalSoundSpeed`` (external, ct only)
    When ``EquationOfState = 1``, this is the
    sound speed used for computation of pressure.  Default: 1

``MHDCTSlopeLimiter`` (external, ct only)
    For computing derivatives for the reconstruction,
    this switches between zero slope (0), minmod (1), VanLeer (2), and
    characteristic  (3) characteristic with primitive limiting (4).  Default: 1

``ReconstructionMethod`` (external)
    There are two reconstruction methods
    that work with MHDCT: Piecewise Linear Method (PLM) (0) and MUSCL-Hancock (6).  This
    formulation of MUSCL-Hancock is different from the 2nd order Runga Kutta used for
    ``HydroMethod = 3,4``.

``RiemannSolver`` (external)
    As with ``HydroMethod=4``, the preferred solver is
    HLLD (``RiemannSolver=6``).  Other solvers may be released if the DOE approves
    them.


``MHDCTUseSpecificEnergy`` (external)
    Either specific energy is used internally
    (1) or conserved energy is used internally (0).  Minor difference in boundary
    condition update, included for comparison to old solutions.  Default: 1


``MHDCTDualEnergyMethod`` (external)
    When ``DualEnergyFormalism = 1``, this switches
    between a method that solves an additional equation for the internal energy, as
    in the rest of Enzo, and method that updates the entropy.


``MHD_WriteElectric`` (external)
    Include the electric field in the output.
    Default: 0

``MHD_ProjectB`` (internal)
    Project magnetic fields from fine to coarse.

``MHD_ProjectE`` (internal)
    Project Electric fields from fine to coarse.

.. _mhd_dender_parameters:

Magnetohydrodynamics (Dedner) Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following parameters are considered only when ``HydroMethod`` is 3 or 4 (and occasionally only in some test problems).
Because many of the following parameters are not actively being tested and maintained, users are encouraged to carefully examine the code before using it.

``UsePoissonDivergenceCleaning`` (external)
    Enables additional divergence cleaning by solving a Poisson equation.
    This works on top of the standard mixed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning
    and is not necessary for the proper operation of the solver.
    This works on individual grids, i.e., it's *not* a global divergence purge.
    Use with care as this feature is not extensively tested.  No recommendation
    about the use of this option is made by the developers at this time.
    Method 1 and 2 are a failed experiment to do divergence cleaning
    using successive over relaxation. Method 3 uses conjugate gradient
    with a 2 cell stencil and Method 4 uses a 4 cell stencil. 4 is more
    accurate but can lead to aliasing effects. Default: 0
``PoissonDivergenceCleaningBoundaryBuffer`` (external)
    Choose to *not* correct in the active zone of a grid by a
    boundary of cells this thick. Default: 0

``UseResistivity`` (external)
    This parameter is used to add resistivity and thereby update magnetic fields in some set-ups; see ComputeResistivity in hydro_rk/Grid_AddResistivity.C.  Default: 0
``UsePhysicalUnit`` (external)
    For some test problems (mostly in hydro_rk), the relevant parameters could be defined in physical CGS units.  Default: 0
``MixSpeciesAndColors`` (external)
    This parameter enables color fields to be evolved as species in the MUSCL solvers. If ``PopIIISupernovaUseColour`` is on, this must also be turned on to trace the metal field. Default: 1

``SmallT`` (external)
    Minimum value for temperature in hydro_rk/EvolveLevel_RK.C.  Default: 1e-10 (note that the default value assumes UsePhysicalUnit = 1)
``SmallP``

    Flux limiter in the minmod Van Leer formulation.  Must be between 1 (most dissipative) and 2 (least dissipative). Default: 1.5

``EOSGamma`` (external)
    Polytropic gamma to be used in EOS.h for EOSType = 1. Default: 1.667
``DivBDampingLength`` (external)
    From C_h (the Dedner wave speeds at which the div*B error is isotropically transferred; as defined in e.g. Matsumoto, PASJ, 2007, 59, 905) and this parameter, C_p (the decay rate of the wave) is calculated; see ComputeDednerWaveSpeeds.C  Default: 1.0

.. _cooling_parameters:

Cooling Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _simple_cooling_parameters:

Simple Cooling Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``RadiativeCooling`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) controls whether or not a radiative
    cooling module is called for each grid. There are currently several
    possibilities, controlled by the value of another flag. See :ref:`cooling`
    for more information on the various cooling methods.  Default: 0

    -  If the ``MultiSpecies`` flag is off, then equilibrium cooling is
       assumed and one of the following two will happen. If the parameter
       ``GadgetCooling`` is set to 1, the primordial equilibrium code is
       called (see below). If ``GadgetCooling`` is set to 0, a file called
       ``cool_rates.in`` is read to set a cooling curve. This file consists
       of a set of temperature and the associated cgs cooling rate; a
       sample compute with a metallicity Z=0.3 Raymond-Smith code is
       provided in ``input/cool_rates.in``. This has a cutoff at 10000 K
       (Sarazin & White 1987). Another choice will be
       ``input/cool_rates.in_300K`` which goes further down to 300 K (Rosen
       & Bregman 1995).
    -  If the ``MultiSpecies`` flag is on, then the cooling rate is
       computed directly by the species abundances. This routine (which
       uses a backward differenced multi-step algorithm) is borrowed
       from the Hercules code written by Peter Anninos and Yu Zhang,
       featuring rates from Tom Abel. Other varieties of cooling are
       controlled by the ``MetalCooling`` parameter, as discused below.
``RadiativeCoolingModel`` (external)
    This switches between the tabular look up cooling that is standard (RadiativeCoolingModel=1) and an analytic fit to the Wolfire et al 2003, ApJ, 587, 278 made by Koyama and Inutsuka 2006 (RadiativeCoolingModel = 3, arXiv:astro-ph/0605528).  Default: 1
``GadgetCooling`` (external)
    This flag (1 - on, 0 - off) turns on (when set to 1) a set of
    routines that calculate cooling rates based on the assumption of a
    six-species primordial gas (H, He, no H2 or D) in equilibrium, and
    is valid for temperatures greater than 10,000 K. This requires the
    file ``TREECOOL`` to execute. Default: 0
``GadgetEquilibriumCooling`` (external)
    An implementation of the ionization equilibrium cooling code used
    in the GADGET code which includes both radiative cooling and a
    uniform metagalactic UV background specified by the ``TREECOOL`` file
    (in the ``amr_mpi/exe`` directory). When this parameter is turned on,
    ``MultiSpecies`` and ``RadiationFieldType`` are forced to 0 and
    ``RadiativeCooling`` is forced to 1.
    [Not in public release version]
``MetalCooling`` (external)
    This flag (0 - off, 1 - metal cooling from Glover & Jappsen 2007,
    2 - Cen et al (1995), 3 - Cloudy cooling from Smith, Sigurdsson, &
    Abel 2008) turns on metal cooling for runs that track
    metallicity. Option 1 is valid for temperatures between 100 K and
    10\ :sup:`8`\ K because it considers fine-structure line emission
    from carbon, oxygen, and silicon and includes the additional metal
    cooling rates from Sutherland & Dopita (1993). Option 2 is only
    valid for temperatures above 10\ :sup:`4`\ K. Option 3 uses
    multi-dimensional tables of heating/cooling values created with
    Cloudy and optionally coupled to the ``MultiSpecies``
    chemistry/cooling solver. This method is valid from 10 K to 10\
    :sup:`8`\ K. See the Cloudy Cooling parameters below.  Default: 0.
``MetalCoolingTable`` (internal)
    This field contains the metal cooling table required for
    ``MetalCooling`` option 1. In the top level directory input/, there are
    two files ``metal_cool.dat`` and ``metal_cool_pop3.dat`` that consider
    metal cooling for solar abundance and abundances from
    pair-instability supernovae, respectively. In the same directory,
    one can find an IDL routine (``make_Zcool_table.pro``) that generates
    these tables. Default: ``metal_cool.dat``
``MultiSpecies`` (external)
    If this flag (1, 2, 3- on, 0 - off) is on, then the code follows
    not just the total density, but also the ionization states of
    Hydrogen and Helium. If set to 2, then a nine-species model
    (including H2, H2+ and H-) will be computed, otherwise only six
    species are followed (H, H+, He, He+, He++, e-). If set to 3, then
    a 12 species model is followed, including D, D+ and HD. This
    routine, like the last one, is based on work done by Abel, Zhang
    and Anninos. Default: 0
``MultiMetals`` (external)
    This was added so that the user could turn on or off additional
    metal fields - currently there is the standard metallicity field
    (Metal_Density) and two additional metal fields (Z_Field1 and
    Z_Field2). Acceptable values are 1 or 0, Default: 0 (off).
``ThreeBodyRate`` (external)
    Which Three Body rate should be used for H2 formation?: 0 = Abel, Bryan, Norman 2002, 1 = PSS83, 2= CW83, 3 = FH07, 4= G08.  (See `Turk et al 2011 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...726...55T>`)
``CIECooling`` (external)
    Should CIE (`Ripamonti & Abel 2004 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.348.1019R>`) cooling be included at high densities?
``H2OpticalDepthApproximation`` (external)
    Should the H2 cooling be attenuated? Taken from `Ripamonti & Abel 2004 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.348.1019R>`. Default: 1?
``H2FormationOnDust`` (external)
    Turns on H2 formation on dust grains and gas-grain heat transfer following `Omukai (2000) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...534..809O>`. Default: 0 (OFF)
``NumberOfDustTemperatureBins`` (external)
    Number of dust temperature bins for the dust cooling and H2 formation rates.  Default: 250
``DustTemperatureStart`` (external)
    Minimum dust temperature for dust rates.  Default: 1.0
``DustTemperatureEnd`` (external)
    Maximum dust temperature for dust rates.  Default: 1500
``OutputDustTemperature`` (external)
    Flag to write out the dust temperature field.  Default: 0
``PhotoelectricHeating`` (external)
    If set to be 1, the following parameter will be added uniformly
    to the gas without any shielding (`Tasker & Bryan 2008 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...673..810T>`). Default: 0
``PhotoelectricHeatingRate`` (external)
    This is the parameter used as Gamma_pe for uniform photoelectric heating.
    Default: 8.5e-26 erg s^-1 cm^-3

.. _cloudy_cooling:

Cloudy Cooling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cloudy cooling from Smith, Sigurdsson, & Abel (2008) interpolates
over tables of precomputed cooling data. Cloudy cooling is turned
on by setting ``MetalCooling`` to 3. ``RadiativeCooling`` must also be set
to 1. Depending on the cooling data used, it can be coupled with
``MultiSpecies`` = 1, 2, or 3 so that the metal-free cooling comes from
the ``MultiSpecies`` machinery and the Cloudy tables provide only the
metal cooling. Datasets range in dimension from 1 to 5. Dim 1:
interpolate over temperature. Dim 2: density and temperature. Dim
3: density, metallicity, and temperature. Dim 4: density,
metallicity, electron fraction, and temperature. Dim 5: density,
metallicity, electron fraction, spectral strength, and temperature.
See Smith, Sigurdsson, & Abel (2008) for more information on
creating Cloudy datasets.

``CloudyCoolingGridFile`` (external)
    A string specifying the path to the Cloudy cooling dataset.
``IncludeCloudyHeating`` (external)
    An integer (0 or 1) specifying whether the heating rates are to be
    included in the calculation of the cooling. Some Cloudy datasets
    are made with the intention that only the cooling rates are to be
    used. Default: 0 (off).
``CMBTemperatureFloor`` (external)
    An integer (0 or 1) specifying whether a temperature floor is
    created at the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
    (T\ :sub:`CMB`\  = 2.72 (1 + z) K). This is accomplished in the
    code by subtracting the cooling rate at T\ :sub:`CMB`\  such that
    Cooling = Cooling(T) - Cooling(T\ :sub:`CMB`\ ). Default: 1 (on).
``CloudyElectronFractionFactor`` (external)
    A float value to account for additional electrons contributed by
    metals. This is only used with Cloudy datasets with dimension
    greater than or equal to 4. The value of this factor is calculated
    as the sum of (A\ :sub:`i`\  \* i) over all elements i heavier than
    He, where A\ :sub:`i`\  is the solar number abundance relative to
    H. For the solar abundance pattern from the latest version of
    Cloudy, using all metals through Zn, this value is 9.153959e-3.
    Default: 9.153959e-3.

.. _grackle_pars:

The Grackle
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Grackle is an external chemistry and cooling library originally derived from
Enzo's MultiSpecies chemistry and Cloudy cooling modules.  See :ref:`here <Grackle>`
for a full description, including why you might use this over Enzo's internal
chemistry and cooling.  For more information on Grackle parameter, see also the
`Grackle documentation <https://grackle.readthedocs.org/>`_.  Note, some Grackle
parameters have been mapped to Enzo parameters for simplicity.

``use_grackle`` (int)
    Flag to use the Grackle machinery (1 - on, 0 - off). Default: 0.

``with_radiative_cooling`` (int)
    Flag to include radiative cooling and actually update the thermal energy during the chemistry solver.  If off, the chemistry species will still be updated.  The most common reason to set this to off is to iterate the chemistry network to an equilibrium state (1 - on, 0 - off).  Default: 1.

``MultiSpecies`` (int) [mapped to Grackle parameter ``primordial_chemistry``]
    Flag to control which primordial chemistry network is used.  Default: 0.

    - 1: 6-species atomic H and He.  Active species: H, H\ :sup:`+`, He, He\ :sup:`+`, He\ :sup:`++`, e\ :sup:`-`.
    - 2: 9-species network including atomic species above and species for molecular hydrogen formation.  This network includes formation from the H\ :sup:`-` and H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+` channels, three-body formation (H+H+H and H+H+H\ :sub:`2`), H\ :sub:`2` rotational transitions, chemical heating, and collision-induced emission (optional).  Active species: above + H\ :sup:`-`, H\ :sub:`2`, H\ :sub:`2`\ :sup:`+`.
    - 3: 12-species network include all above plus HD rotation cooling.  Active species: above plus D, D\ :sup:`+`, HD.

    See Enzo equivalent above.  Default: 0.

``MetalCooling`` (int) [mapped to Grackle parameter ``metal_cooling``]
    Flag to enable metal cooling using the Cloudy tables.  If enabled, the cooling table to be used must be specified with the ``grackle_data_file`` parameter (1 - on, 0 - off).  Default: 0.

``CMBTemperatureFloor`` (int) [mapped to Grackle parameter ``cmb_temperature_floor``]
    See Enzo equivalent above.  Default: 1.

``UVbackground`` (int)
    Flag to enable a UV background.  If enabled, the cooling table to be used must be specified with the ``grackle_data_file`` parameter (1 - on, 0 - off).  Default: 0.

``LWbackground_sawtooth_suppression`` (int)
    Flag to enable suppression of Lyman-Werner flux due to Lyman-series absorption (giving a sawtooth pattern), taken from `Haiman & Abel, & Rees (2000) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...534...11H>`_.  Default: 0.

.. _particle_parameters:

Particle Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ParticleBoundaryType`` (external)
    The boundary condition imposed on particles. At the moment, this
    parameter is largely ceremonial as there is only one type
    implemented: periodic, indicated by a 0 value. Default: 0
``ParticleCourantSafetyNumber`` (external)
    This somewhat strangely named parameter is the maximum fraction of
    a cell width that a particle is allowed to travel per timestep
    (i.e. it is a constant on the timestep somewhat along the lines of
    it's hydrodynamic brother). Default: 0.5
``NumberOfParticles`` (obsolete)
    Currently ignored by all initializers, except for TestGravity and
    TestGravitySphere where it is the number of test points. Default: 0
``NumberOfParticleAttributes`` (internal)
    It is set to 3 if either ``StarParticleCreation`` or
    ``StarParticleFeedback`` is set to 1 (TRUE). Default: 0
``ParallelParticleIO`` (external)
    Normally, for the mpi version, the particle data are read into the
    root processor and then distributed to separate processors.
    However, for very large number of particles, the root processor may
    not have enough memory. If this toggle switch is set on (i.e. to
    the value 1), then Ring i/o is turned on and each processor reads
    its own part of the particle data. More I/O is required, but it is
    more balanced in terms of memory. ``ParallelRootGridIO`` and
    ``ParallelParticleIO`` MUST be set for runs involving > 64 cpus!
    See also ``ParallelRootGridIO`` in :ref:`io_parameters`.
    Default: 0 (FALSE).
``ParticleSplitterIterations`` (external)
    Set to 1 to split particles into 13 particles (= 12 children+1
    parent, Kitsionas & Whitworth (2002)). This should be ideal for
    setting up an low-resolution initial condition for a relatively low
    computational cost, running it for a while, and then restarting it
    for an extremely high-resolution simulation in a focused region.
    Currently it implicitly assumes that only DM (type=1) and
    conventional star particles (type=2) inside the ``RefineRegion`` get
    split. Other particles, which usually become Star class objects,
    seem to have no reason to be split. It is reset to zero after a

    Random seed used when randomly rotating the hexagonal close
    packed array on whose vertices the split particles are
    placed. Default: 131180

    Set to 1 to mark the split particles as must-refine particles. The
    user must also set associated must-refine parameters to enable its
    machinery that can be used to restrict AMR only to the must-refine
    particles. Default: 0
``ParticleSplitterMustRefineIDFile`` (external)
    Filename for the HDF5 file that has a dataset containing the
    particle IDs that should be marked as must-refine.  All other
    particles within the region marked for splitting will retain their
    original types.  If not set, all particles within the must-refine
    region will be must-refine particles.  This must be used in
    conjunction with ``ParticleSplitterMustRefine = 1``.  The dataset
    must be named ``particle_identifier`` in the base group.  Default:
    (null).

    An example yt script is provided below, selecting the particles in
    a sphere centered at [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] with a radius 0.05 in code

    routines can be used in a single simulation. For example if methods
    1 and 3 are desired, the user would specify 10 (2\ :sup:`1`\  +

``StarParticleFeedback`` (external)
    This parameter works the same way as ``StarParticleCreation`` but only
    is valid for ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 0, 1, 2, 7, 8 and 14 because methods 3, 5 and 9
    use the radiation transport module and ``Star_*.C`` routines to
    calculate the feedback, 4 has explicit feedback and 10 does not use feedback. Default: 0.

``StarFeedbackDistRadius`` (external)
    If this parameter is greater than zero, stellar feedback will be
    deposited into the host cell and neighboring cells within this
    radius.  This results in feedback being distributed to a cube with
    a side of ``StarFeedbackDistRadius+1``. It is in units of cell
    widths of the finest grid which hosts the star particle.  Only
    implemented for ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 0 or 1 with ``StarParticleFeedback`` method =  1. (If ``StarParticleFeedback`` = 0, stellar feedback is only deposited into the cell in which the star particle lives).  Default: 0.

``StarFeedbackDistCellStep`` (external)
    In essence, this parameter controls the shape of the volume where
    the feedback is applied, cropping the original cube.  This volume
    that are within ``StarFeedbackDistCellSteps`` cells from the host
    cell, counted in steps in Cartesian directions, are injected with
    stellar feedback.  Its maximum value is ``StarFeedbackDistRadius``
    * ``TopGridRank``.  Only implemented for ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 0
    or 1  with ``StarParticleFeedback`` method =  1.  See :ref:`distributed_feedback` for an illustration.
    Default: 0.

``StarMakerUseJeansMass`` (external)
    This parameter controls the usage of the Jeans Mass check for
    star formation. When spatial resolution gets high enough to
    resolve the Jeans length, the Jeans Mass check restricts star
    formation that should occur. Only implemented for
    ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 1 (e.g. ``star_marker_2``).
    Default: 1.

``StarMakerTypeIaSNe`` (external)
    This parameter turns on thermal and chemical feedback from Type Ia
    supernovae.  The mass loss and luminosity of the supernovae are
    determined from `fits of K. Nagamine
    <http://www.physics.unlv.edu/~kn/SNIa_2/>`_.  The ejecta are
    traced in a separate species field, ``MetalSNIa_Density``.  The
    metallicity of star particles that comes from this ejecta is
    stored in the particle attribute ``typeia_fraction``.  Can be used
    with ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 13.  Default:
    0.

``StarMakerPlanetaryNebulae`` (external)
    This parameter turns on thermal and chemical feedback from
    planetary nebulae.  The mass loss and luminosity are taken from
    the same `fits from K. Nagamine
    <http://www.physics.unlv.edu/~kn/SNIa_2/>`_.  The chemical
    feedback injects gas with the same metallicity as the star
    particle, and the thermal feedback equates to a 10 km/s wind.  The
    ejecta are not stored in its own species field.  Can be used
    with ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 13.  Default: 0.

``StarParticleRadiativeFeedback`` (external)
    By setting this parameter to 1, star particles created with
    methods (0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 13) will become radiation sources with
    the UV luminosity being determined with the parameter
    ``StarEnergyToStellarUV``.  Default: OFF

.. _normal_star_formation_parameters:

Normal Star Formation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameters below are considered in ``StarParticleCreation`` method
0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 13 and 14.

``StarMakerOverDensityThreshold`` (external)
    The overdensity threshold in code units (for cosmological simulations, note that code units are relative to the total mean density, not
    just the dark matter mean density) before star formation will be
    considered. For ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 7 in cosmological
    simulations, however, ``StarMakerOverDensityThreshold`` should be in
    particles/cc, so it is not the ratio with respect to the
    ``DensityUnits`` (unlike most other
    star_makers). This way one correctly represents the Jeans
    collapse and molecular cloud scale physics even in cosmological
    simulations. Default: 100
``StarMakerSHDensityThreshold`` (external)
    The critical density of gas used in Springel & Hernquist star
    formation ( \\rho_{th} in the paper) used to determine the star
    formation timescale in units of g cm\ :sup:`-3`\ . Only valid for ``StarParticleCreation`` method = 8. Default: 7e-26.
``StarMakerMassEfficiency`` (external)
    The fraction of identified baryonic mass in a cell
    (Mass\*dt/t_dyn) that is converted into a star particle. Default:
    1
``StarMakerMinimumMass`` (external)
    The minimum mass of star particle, in solar masses. Note however,
    the star maker algorithm 2 has a (default off) "stochastic" star formation
    algorithm that will, in a pseudo-random fashion, allow star
    formation even for very low star formation rates. It attempts to do
    so (relatively successfully according to tests) in a fashion that
    conserves the global average star formation rate. Default: 1e9
``StarMakerMinimumDynamicalTime`` (external)
    When the star formation rate is computed, the rate is proportional
    to M_baryon \* dt/max(t_dyn, t_max) where t_max is this
    parameter. This effectively sets a limit on the rate of star
    formation based on the idea that stars have a non-negligible
    formation and life-time. The unit is years. Default: 1e6
``StarMakerTimeIndependentFormation`` (external)
    When used, the factor of dt / t_dyn is removed from the calculation of
    the star particle mass above.  Instead of the local dynamical time, the
    timescale over which feedback occurs is a constant set by the parameter
    ``StarMakerMinimumDynamicalTime``.  This is necessary when running with
    conduction as the timesteps can be very short, which causes the calculated
    star particle mass to never exceed reasonable values for
    ``StarMakerMinimumMass``.  This prevents cold, star-forming gas from
    actually forming stars, and when combined with conduction, results in too
    much heat being transferred out of hot gas.  When running a cosmological
    simulation with conduction and star formation, one must use this otherwise
    bad things will happen.  (1 - ON; 0 - OFF)  Default: 0.
``StarMassEjectionFraction`` (external)
    The mass fraction of created stars which is returned to the gas
    phase. Default: 0.25
``StarMetalYield`` (external)

    created (i.e. it is multiplied by mstar, not ejected). Default:
    0.02
``StarEnergyToThermalFeedback`` (external)
    The fraction of the rest-mass energy of the stars created which is
    returned to the gas phase as thermal energy. Default: 1e-5
``StarEnergyToStellarUV`` (external)
    The fraction of the rest-mass energy of the stars created which is
    returned as UV radiation with a young star spectrum. This is used
    when calculating the radiation background. Default: 3e-6
``StarEnergyToQuasarUV`` (external)
    The fraction of the rest-mass energy of the stars created which is
    returned as UV radiation with a quasar spectrum. This is used when
    calculating the radiation background. Default: 5e-6
``StarFeedbackKineticFraction`` (external)
    Only valid for ``StarParticleFeedback`` method = 14.  If set to a zero or positive
    value between 0.0 and 1.0, this is the constant fraction of energy injected in kinetic
    form.  If set to -1, then a variable kinetic fraction is used that depends on local
    gas density, metallicity and resolution.  See Simpson et al. 2015
    for details. Note, some failures may occur in -1 mode.  Default 0.0
``StarMakerExplosionDelayTime`` (external)
    Only valid for ``StarParticleFeedback`` method = 14.  If set to a positive value, energy,
    metals and mass from the particle are injected in a single timestep that is delayed from
    the particle creation time by this amount.  This value is in units of Myrs.  If set
    to a negative value, energy, mass and metals are injected gradually in the same way as is
    done for ``StarParticleFeedback`` method = 1.  Default -1.
``StarMakerMinimumMassRamp`` (external)
     Sets the Minimum Stellar Mass (otherwise given by StarMakerMinimumMass to
     ramp up over time, so that a small mass can be used early in the calculation
     and a higher mass later on, or vice versa. The minimum mass is "ramped"
     up or down starting at StarMakerMinimumMassRampStartTime and ending
     at StarMakerMinimumMassRampEndTime. The acceptable values are:
     (1) linear evolution of mass in time
     (2) linear evolution of mass in redshift
     (3) exponential evolution of mass in time
     (4) exponential evolution of mass in redshift
``StarMakerMinimumMassRampStartTime`` (external)
     The code unit time, or redshift, to start the ramp of the StarMakerMinimumMass
     Before this time the minimum mass will have a constant value given
     by StarMakerMinimumMassRampStartMass
``StarMakerMinimumMassRampEndTime`` (external)
     The code unit time, or redshift, to start the ramp of the StarMakerMinimumMass
     After this time the minimum mass will have a constant value given
     by StarMakerMinimumMassRampEndMass
``StarMakerMinimumMassRampStartMass`` (external)
     The mass at which to start the ramp in the minimum stellar mass. This mass
     will be used at all times before StarMakerMinimumMassRampStartTime as well.
``StarMakerMinimumMassRampEndMass`` (external)
     The mass at which to end the ramp in the minimum stellar mass. This mass
     will be used at all times after StarMakerMinimumMassRampEndTime as well.

Set to 4 to turn on angular momentum limited accretion based on the formalism adopted
by `Rosas-Guevara et al. (2015) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0598.pdf>`__.

Set to 5 to again turn on spherical Bondi-Hoyle accretion but this time the
formalism includes a correction which accounts for the vorticity of the gas
based on `Krumholz et al. (2005) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/426051/pdf>`__.

Set to 6 to use the viscous angular momentum prescription from `DeBuhr et al. (2010) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.2872.pdf>`__.

Set to 7 to use a  modified accretion rate based on the alpha-disk model of Shakura & Sunyaev (1973)
This scheme is based on `Cen et al. <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/755/1/28/pdf>`__.

Set to 8 to employ the converging mass flux approach. This is not based on any indirect properties of the
gas as above and simply measures the flow of gas through the accetion radius of the ``SmartStar``. It is based
on the accretion mechanism used by `Bleuler <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6528.pdf>`__  in Ramses and in Enzo
by Regan et al. (`2018 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04527.pdf>`__, `2019 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04953.pdf>`__).

Default: 8


Accretion is never capped by default but can be capped at the Eddington rate as notes below.



SmartStar Feedback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``SmartStarFeedback`` (external)
    This is the master feedback parameter. Set this to 0 and all feedback
    is turned off. It's a master switch. Switch it to 1 and then feedback is on but needs to
    be fine grained by more detailed parameters below.
    Default: 0

``SmartStarStellarRadiativeFeedback`` (external)
    This parameter controls whether stellar feedback is activated or not. For feedback from PopIII or SMSs then this needs to be on.
    The stellar radiative feedback is divided up into 5 energy bins. The energy bins have energies of 2.0 eV, 12.8 eV, 14.0 eV, 25.0 eV
    and 200 eV. The fraction of energy assigned to each bin is determined using the PopIII tables from Schaerer et. al 2002 Table 4.
    The spectrum for a PopIII star and SMS are different. For a PopIII star a spectrum for a 40 Msolar star is assumed and
    weighted accordingly. For a SMS a 1000 Msolar star is assumed and weighted accordingly.
    Future improvements to the SEDs employed here are under active investigation.
    Default: 0

``SmartStarBHFeedback`` (external)
    This is a master switch on black hole feedback. Must be turned on if you want black hole feedback. Default: 0

``SmartStarBHRadiativeFeedback`` (external)
    This parameter controls whether black hole radiative feedback gets turned on or not. When turned on the radiative
    feedback from a black hole depends both on the mass of the black hole and the accretion rate onto the black hole. Both of these
    quantities are captured and stored as part of the ``SmartStar``. Details of the SED used can be found in the appendix of
    `Regan et al. 2019 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04953>`__ and is made from assuming a multi-colour disk for the accretion disk and a corona fit by a
    power law.  The radiation emitted by the accretion disk is hard-coded is be emitted by 5 bins with energies of
    2.0 eV, 12.8 eV, 19.1 eV, 217.3 eV and 5190 eV. The fraction of energy assigned to each bin is then determined by the mass of the
    black hole and the associated accretion rate at a given time. The formalism is valid for black hole masses between 1 Msolar and
    1e9 Msolar and for accretion rates between 1e-6 Msolar/yr and 1e3 Msolar/yr.  Default: 0

``SmartStarBHThermalFeedback`` (external)
    This parameter controls whether the black hole thermal feedback gets turned. Thre thermal energy is generated by feedback through the
    accretion process. If this is turned on then the ``SmartStarBHRadiativeFeedback`` should presumably be turned off unless you have a
    good reason to include both. The efficiency, epsilon, depends on both the spin of the black hole and the ISCO oribit. In order to
    calculate this accurately Eqn 32 from Abromowicz & Fragile (2013) is used. See ActiveParticle_SmartStar.h. The feedback is released
    iostropically in a sphere surrounding the SmartStar particle.  Default: 0

``SmartStarBHJetFeedback`` (external)
    The methodology for this algorithm is based on that of `Kim et. al (2011) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4007.pdf>`__. Jets can be activated
    when a spinning black hole is accreting. The jets are bipolar and are set along the angular momentum vector of the SmartStar. The
    velocity of the jet(s) is set by a separate parameter below. No other parameters need to be set to activate the jet.  Default: 0

``SmartStarEddingtonCap`` (external)
    This parameter allows for accretion onto the SmartStar to be capped at the Eddington limit.
    Default: 0

``SmartStarSpin`` (external)
    The dimensionless spin of the SmartStar particle. This is a very unconstrained parameter and cannot be readily computed on the fly. This parameter
    should be set if you want to have jet feedback. Setting this is zero and turning on jet feedback wouldn't make sense. The default is set to be 0.7 and
    this is probably reasonable.
    Default: 0.7

``SmartStarSMSLifetime`` (external)
    This is the lifetime for a supermassive star in years. After this time has elapsed a SmartStar particle which is behaving like a SMS will collapse
    directly into a black hole with no supernova event. Default: 1e6

``SmartStarJetVelocity`` (external)
    The velocity that the jets are ejected at. Typically jets are observed to travel at a substantial fraction of the speed of light -
    especially those ejected during periods of high accretion. However,
    as mass gets entrained in the jet it slows down. The units of this parameter are as a fraction of the speed of light. Default: 0.1

``SmartStarFeedbackJetsThresholdMass`` (external)
    Jets are only ejected once this amount of mass is available for ejection after an accretion event. Therefore, if there is very limited
    accretion and this parameter is set high then jets will be very infrequent. In units of solar masses. Default: 1.0

``SmartStarSuperEddingtonAdjustment`` (external)
    As accretion rates exceed the canonical Eddington rate the radiative efficiency of the feedback changes. We use the fits from `Madau et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6995.pdf>`__
    to adjust the efficiency when accretion enters the super-critical regime. The fits are based on the slim-disk model of accretion which generates inefficient feedback.
    Default: 1

.. _radiation_backgrounds:

Background Radiation Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``RadiationFieldType`` (external)
    This integer parameter specifies the type of radiation field that
    is to be used. Except for ``RadiationFieldType`` = 9, which should
    be used with ``MultiSpecies`` = 2, UV backgrounds can currently
    only be used with ``MultiSpecies`` = 1 (i.e. no molecular H
    support). The following values are used.  For field type 15, see
    Table 3 in `Haardt & Madau (2012)
    <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...746..125H />`_. Default: 0

     2  - Haardt & Madau spectrum with q_alpha = 1.8
     3  - Modified Haardt & Madau spectrum to match observations
        (Kirkman & Tytler 2005).
     4  - Haardt & Madau spectrum with q_alpha = 1.5 supplemented with an X-ray Compton heating
          background from Madau & Efstathiou (see astro-ph/9902080)

     10 - Internally computed radiation field using the algorithm of Cen & Ostriker
     11 - Same as previous, but with very, very simple optical shielding fudge
     12 - Haardt & Madau spectrum with q_alpha = 1.57
     15 - Haardt & Madau 2012.

``RadiationFieldLevelRecompute`` (external)
    This integer parameter is used only if the previous parameter is
    set to 10 or 11. It controls how often (i.e. the level at which)
    the internal radiation field is recomputed. Default: 0
``RadiationSpectrumNormalization`` (external)
    This parameter was initially used to normalize the photo-ionization
    and photo-heating rates computed in the function
    ``RadiationFieldCalculateRates()`` and then passed on to the
    ``calc_photo_rates()``, ``calc_rad()`` and ``calc_rates()`` routines.
    Later, the normalization as a separate input parameter was dropped
    for all cases by using the rates computed in
    ``RadiationFieldCalculateRates()`` with one exception: The molecular
    hydrogen (H2) dissociation rate. There a normalization is performed
    on the rate by multiplying it with ``RadiationSpectrumNormalization``.
    Default: 1e-21
``RadiationShield`` (external)
    This parameter specifies whether the user wants to employ
    approximate radiative-shielding. This parameter will be
    automatically turned on when RadiationFieldType is set to 11. When
    set to 1, it calculates shielding for H/He. See
    ``calc_photo_rates.src`` for more details.  When set to 2, it
    shields only H2 with the Sobolev-like approximation from
    Wolcott-Green et al. (2011).  Default: 0
``RadiationFieldRedshift`` (external)
    This parameter specifies the redshift at which the radiation field
    is calculated.  If a UV radiation background is used in a
    non-cosmological simulation, this needs to be defined. Negative
    redshifts are permitted. Default: (undefined)
``RadiationRedshiftOn`` (external)
    The redshift at which the UV
    background turns on. Default: 7.0.
``RadiationRedshiftFullOn`` (external)
    The redshift at which the UV
    background is at full strength.  Between z =
    ``RadiationRedshiftOn`` and z = ``RadiationRedshiftFullOn``, the
    background is gradually ramped up to full strength. Default: 6.0.
``RadiationRedshiftDropOff`` (external)
    The redshift at which the
    strength of the UV background is begins to gradually reduce,
    reaching zero by ``RadiationRedshiftOff``. Default: 0.0.

    The redshift at which the UV
    background is fully off. Default: 0.0.
``TabulatedLWBackground`` (external)

Radiative Transfer (Ray Tracing) Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``RadiativeTransfer`` (external)

    packages. Default: 0

``RadiativeTransferCoupledRateSolver`` (external)
    Set to 1 to calculate the new ionization fractions and gas energies
    after every radiative transfer timestep. This option is highly
    recommended to be kept on. If not, ionization fronts will propagate too
    slowly. Default: 1.
``RadiativeTransferOpticallyThinH2`` (external)
    Set to 1 to include an optically-thin H_2 dissociating
    (Lyman-Werner) radiation field. This also causes the HM and H2II
    to be dissociated in an opticall thin fashion.
    Only used if ``MultiSpecies`` > 1.  If ``MultiSpecies`` > 1 and
    this option is off, the Lyman-Werner radiation
    field will be calculated with ray tracing. Default: 1.
``RadiativeTransferOpticallyThinH2CharLength`` (external)
    This parameter controls the length over which the Jeans length self shielding
    prescription is performed. The default value is 0.25 which means that the
    characteristic length for applying self shielding of LW photons is over one
    quarter of the Jeans length. Leaving at this value is probably a good idea
    unless there is a strong reason to modify it. Default: 0.25.
``RadiativeTransferSplitPhotonPackage`` (external)

``RadiativeTransferHubbleTimeFraction`` (external)
    Photon packages are deleted when its associated photo-ionization
    timescale, considering the limit when all photons are absorbed in
    one cell, drops below a fraction (this parameter) of a Hubble
    time.  This parameter can be safely set to 0.01 when ray merging
    is used.  Default: 0.1
``RadiativeTransferFluxBackgroundLimit`` (external)
    When the flux of a photon package drops below a fraction (this
    parameter) of the background radiation field, the ray is deleted.
    Only used with ray merging.  Default: 0.01
``RadiativeTransferPhotonEscapeRadius`` (external)
    The number of photons that pass this distance from its source are
    summed into the global variable ``EscapedPhotonCount[]``. This variable
    also keeps track of the number of photons passing this radius
    multiplied by 0.5, 1, and 2. Units are in kpc. Not used if set to
    0. Default: 0.
``RadiativeTransferSourceClustering`` (external)

    which is the luminosity weighted center of two sources. This radius
    is in units of the separation of two sources associated with one
    SuperSource. If set too small, there will be angular artifacts in
    the radiation field. Default: 2.5
``RadiativeTransferSourceBeamAngle`` (external)
    Rays will be emitted within this angle in degrees of the poles from sources with "Beamed" types.  Default: 30

    packages. Default: 0.
``RadiativeTransferTimestepVelocityLimit`` (external)
    Limits the radiative transfer timestep to a minimum value that is
    determined by the cell width at the finest level divided by this
    velocity. Units are in km/s. Default: 100.
``RadiativeTransferTimestepVelocityLevel`` (external)
    Limit the ray tracing timestep by a sound crossing time (see
    ``RadiativeTransferTimestepVelocityLimit``) across a
    cell on the level specified with this parameter.  Not used if
    equal to INT_UNDEFINED (-99999).  Default: INT_UNDEFINED
``RadiativeTransferHIIRestrictedTimestep`` (external)
    Adaptive ray tracing timesteps will be restricted by a maximum change of 10% in neutral fraction if this parameter is set to 1.  If set to 2, then the incident flux can change by a maximum of 0.5 between cells.  See Wise & Abel (2011) in Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.4 for more details.  Default: 0
``RadiativeTransferAdaptiveTimestep`` (external)
    Must be 1 when RadiativeTransferHIIRestrictedTimestep is non-zero.  When RadiativeTransferHIIRestrictedTimestep is 0, then the radiative transfer timestep is set to the timestep of the finest AMR level.  Default: 0
``RadiativeTransferLoadBalance`` (external)
    When turned on, the grids are load balanced based on the number of ray segments traced.  The grids are moved to different processors only for the radiative transfer solver.  Default: 0
``RadiativeTransferHydrogenOnly`` (external)
    When turned on, the photo-ionization fields are only created for hydrogen.  Default: 0
``RadiativeTransferRayMaximumLength`` (external)
    The maximum length that a ray is allowed to travel in box units. Thde default value is 1.7320608 (i.e. sqrt(3.0) so a ray covers the entire periodic region with some doubling up inevitably. Setting it to smaller value will reduce the computational cost.
    Default: 1.7320608
``RadiativeTransferUseH2Shielding`` (external)
    Should H2 self-shielding be used.  Default: True
``RadiativeTransferH2ShieldType`` (external)
    If H2 shielding is turned on then which kind should we use. Setting this value to 0 used the self-shielding fit as per
    Draine & Bertoldi (1996). Setting this value to 1 uses the fit as per Wolcott-Green et al. (2011). Default: 0
``RadiativeTransferH2IIDiss`` (external)
    Should we also account for the photo-dissoication of H2II which occurs for radiation between 0.76eV and 13.6 eV.  Default: True
``RadiationXRaySecondaryIon`` (external)
    Set to 1 to turn on secondary ionizations and reduce heating from
    X-ray radiation (Shull & van Steenberg 1985). Currently only BH and
    MBH particles emit X-rays. Default: 0.
``RadiationXRayComptonHeating`` (external)
    Set to 1 to turn on Compton heating on electrons from X-ray
    radiation (Ciotti & Ostriker 2001). Currently only BH and MBH
    particles emit X-rays. Default: 0.
``RadiativeTransferInterpolateField`` (obsolete)
    A failed experiment in which we evaluate the density at the
    midpoint of the ray segment in each cell to calculate the optical
    depth. To interpolate, we need to calculate the vertex interpolated

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``RadiativeTransferFLD`` (external)
    Set to 2 to turn on the fld-based radiation solvers following Reynolds,
    Hayes, Paschos & Norman, 2009. Note that you also have to compile
    the source using ``make photon-yes`` and a ``make
    hypre-yes``. Note that if FLD is turned on, it will force
    ``RadiativeCooling = 0``, ``GadgetEquilibriumCooling = 0``, and
    ``RadiationFieldType = 0`` to prevent conflicts. Default: 0.

    *IMPORTANT*: Set ``RadiativeTransfer = 0`` to avoid conflicts with the ray tracing solver above.

    should be called. Currently only works for 0 (the root grid).
    Default: 0.

    change in the expansion factor in a step is less than this value.
    Default: 0.01
``CosmologyTableNumberOfBins`` (external)

    from a numerically integrated table of log(scale factor) vs. time.
    This parameter sets the number of bins in the table. Default: 1000.
``CosmologyTableLogaInitial`` (external)
    This sets the lower bound of the table used to convert between time
    and redshift. This is log10 of the lowest value of the scale factor.

.. _massive_black_hole_parameters:

Massive Black Hole Physics Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following parameters are for the accretion and feedback from the
massive black hole particle (``PARTICLE_TYPE_MBH``). Details
are described in Kim, Wise, Alvarez, and Abel (2011).

.. _accretion_physics_parameters:

Accretion Physics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``MBHAccretion`` (external)
    Set to 1 to turn on accretion based on the Eddington-limited
    spherical Bondi-Hoyle formula (Bondi 1952). Set to 2 to turn on
    accretion based on the Bondi-Hoyle formula but with fixed
    temperature defined below. Set to 3 to turn on accretion with a
    fixed rate defined below. Set to 4 to to turn on accretion based on
    the Eddington-limited spherical Bondi-Hoyle formula, but without
    v_rel in the denominator. Set to 5 to turn on accretion based on
    Krumholz et al.(2006) which takes vorticity into account. Set to 6
    to turn on alpha disk formalism based on DeBuhr et al.(2010).
    7 and 8 are still failed experiment. Add 10 to each of these options
    (i.e. 11, 12, 13, 14) to ignore the Eddington limit. See
    ``Star_CalculateMassAccretion.C``. Default: 0 (FALSE)
``MBHAccretionRadius`` (external)
    This is the radius (in pc) of a gas sphere from which the accreting
    mass is subtracted out at every timestep. Instead, you may want to
    try set this parameter to -1, in which case an approximate Bondi
    radius is calculated and used (from ``DEFAULT_MU`` and
    ``MBHAccretionFixedTemperature``). If set to -N, it will use N\*(Bondi
    radius). See ``CalculateSubtractionParameters.C``. Default: 50.0
``MBHAccretingMassRatio`` (external)
    There are three different scenarios you can utilize this parameter.
    (1) In principle this parameter is a nondimensional factor
    multiplied to the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate; so 1.0 should give
    the plain Bondi rate. (2) However, if the Bondi radius is resolved
    around the MBH, the local density used to calculate Mdot can be
    higher than what was supposed to be used (density at the Bondi
    radius!), resulting in the overestimation of Mdot. 0.0 <
    ``MBHAccretingMassRatio`` < 1.0 can be used to fix this. (3) Or, one
    might try using the density profile of R\ :sup:`-1.5`\  to estimate
    the density at the Bondi radius, which is utilized when
    ``MBHAccretingMassRatio`` is set to -1. See
    ``Star_CalculateMassAccretion.C``. Default: 1.0
``MBHAccretionFixedTemperature`` (external)
    This parameter (in K) is used when ``MBHAccretion = 2``. A fixed gas
    temperature that goes into the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate
    estimation formula. Default: 3e5
``MBHAccretionFixedRate`` (external)

    method 7) in the cells where MBH particles reside. Default: 0
    (FALSE)
``MBHCombineRadius`` (external)
    The distance (in pc) between two MBH particles in which two
    energetically-bound MBH particles merge to form one particle.

.. _Feedback_physics:

Feedback Physics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``MBHFeedback`` (external)
    Set to 1 to turn on thermal feedback of MBH particles (``MBH_THERMAL``
    - not fully tested). Set to 2 to turn on mechanical feedback of MBH
    particles (``MBH_JETS``, bipolar jets along the total angular momentum
    of gas accreted onto the MBH particle so far). Set to 3 to turn on
    another version of mechanical feedback of MBH particles (``MBH_JETS``,
    always directed along z-axis). Set to 4 to turn on experimental version of
    mechanical feedback (`MBH_JETS`, bipolar jets along the total angular
    momentum of gas accreted onto the MBH particle so far + 10 degree random
    noise).  Set to 5 to turn on experimental version of mechanical feedback
    (``MBH_JETS``, launched at random direction). Note that, even when this
    parameter is set to 0, MBH particles still can be radiation sources
    if ``RadiativeTransfer`` is on. See ``Grid_AddFeedbackSphere.C``.
    Default: 0 (FALSE)

   ::

     ``RadiativeTransfer = 0`` & ``MBHFeedback = 0`` : no feedback at all
     ``RadiativeTransfer = 0`` & ``MBHFeedback = 1`` : purely thermal feedback
     ``RadiativeTransfer = 0`` & ``MBHFeedback = 2`` : purely mechanical feedback
     ``RadiativeTransfer = 1`` & ``MBHFeedback = 0`` : purely radiative feedback
     ``RadiativeTransfer = 1`` & ``MBHFeedback = 2`` : radiative and
       mechanical feedback combined (one has to change the following
       ``MBHFeedbackRadiativeEfficiency`` parameter accordingly, say from 0.1
       to 0.05, to keep the same total energy across different modes of
       feedback)

``MBHFeedbackRadiativeEfficiency`` (external)
    The radiative efficiency of a black hole. 10% is the widely
    accepted value for the conversion rate from the rest-mass energy of
    the accreting material to the feedback energy, at the innermost
    stable orbit of a non-spinning Schwarzschild black hole (Shakura &
    Sunyaev 1973, Booth & Schaye 2009). Default: 0.1
``MBHFeedbackEnergyCoupling`` (external)
    The fraction of feedback energy that is thermodynamically (for
    ``MBH_THERMAL``) or mechanically (for ``MBH_JETS``) coupled to the gas.
    0.05 is widely used for thermal feedback (Springel et al. 2005, Di
    Matteo et al. 2005), whereas 0.0001 or less is recommended for
    mechanical feedback depending on the resolution of the simulation
    (Ciotti et al. 2009). Default: 0.05
``MBHFeedbackMassEjectionFraction`` (external)
    The fraction of accreting mass that is returning to the gas phase.
    For either ``MBH_THERMAL`` or ``MBH_JETS``. Default: 0.1
``MBHFeedbackMetalYield`` (external)
    The mass fraction of metal in the ejected mass. Default: 0.02
``MBHFeedbackThermalRadius`` (external)
    The radius (in pc) of a sphere in which the energy from
    ``MBH_THERMAL`` feedback is deposited. If set to a negative value, the
    radius of a sphere gets bigger in a way that the sphere encloses
    the constant mass (=
    4/3\*pi\*(-``MBHFeedbackThermalRadius``)\ :sup:`3`\  Msun). The latter
    is at the moment very experimental; see ``Star_FindFeedbackSphere.C``.
    Default: 50.0
``MBHFeedbackJetsThresholdMass`` (external)
    The bipolar jets by ``MBH_JETS`` feedback are injected every time the
    accumulated ejecta mass surpasses ``MBHFeedbackJetsThresholdMass`` (in
    Msun). Although continuously injecting jets into the gas cells
    might sound great, unless the gas cells around the MBH are resolved
    down to Mdot, the jets make little or no dynamical impact on the
    surrounding gas. By imposing ``MBHFeedbackJetsThresholdMass``, the jets
    from MBH particles are rendered intermittent, yet dynamically
    important. Default: 10.0
``MBHParticleIO`` (external)
    Set to 1 to print out basic information about MBH particles. Will
    be automatically turned on if ``MBHFeedback`` is set to 2 or 3.
    Default: 0 (FALSE)

``CRCourantSafetyNumber`` (external)
    Multiplies CR diffusion timestep, for stability should be <= 0.5. Default: 0.5

``CRFeedback`` (external)
    Specify fraction of star formation feedback energy should be diverted into the cosmic
    ray energy density. implemented ONLY for star_maker3 (feedback method 2). Default: 0.0

``CRdensFloor`` (external)
    Floor in gas density, can be imposed, for speed purposes (default 0.0 = off). Any value
    larger than 0.0 is on with that value as the floor in code units.

.. _conduction:

Conduction
~~~~~~~~~~

Isotropic and anisotropic thermal conduction are implemented using the
method of Parrish and Stone: namely, using an explicit, forward
time-centered algorithm.  In the anisotropic conduction, heat can only
conduct along magnetic field lines.  One can turn on the two types of
conduction independently, since there are situations where one might
want to use both.  The Spitzer fraction can be also set
independently for the isotropic and anisotropic conduction.  Running a
cosmological simulation with conduction on can be tricky as the timesteps
can become very short.  It is recommended that you look carefully at all the
available conduction parameters.  Additionally, if you intend to run with
star particles, it is highly recommended that you set the parameter,
``StarMakerTimeIndependentFormation``.  See the description in
:ref:`starparticleparameters` for more information.

``IsotropicConduction`` (external)
    Turns on isotropic thermal conduction using Spitzer conduction.  Default: 0 (FALSE)
``AnisotropicConduction`` (external)
    Turns on anisotropic thermal conduction using Spitzer conduction.
    Can only be used if MHD is turned on (``HydroMethod`` = 4).
    Default: 0 (FALSE)
``IsotropicConductionSpitzerFraction`` (external)
    Prefactor that goes in front of the isotropic Spitzer conduction
    coefficient.  Should be a value between 0 and 1.
    Default: 1.0
``AnisotropicConductionSpitzerFraction`` (external)
    Prefactor that goes in front of the anisotropic Spitzer conduction
    coefficient.  Should be a value between 0 and 1.
    Default: 1.0
``ConductionCourantSafetyNumber`` (external)
    This is a prefactor that controls the stability of the conduction
    algorithm.  In its current explicit formulation, it must be set to
    a value of 0.5 or less.
    Default: 0.5
``SpeedOfLightTimeStepLimit`` (external)
    When used, this sets a floor for the conduction timestep to be the local light crossing time (dx / c).  This prevents the conduction machinery from prescribing extremely small timesteps.  While this can technically violate the conduction stability criterion, testing has shown that this does not result in notable differences.  (1 - ON; 0 - OFF)  Default: 0 (OFF).
``ConductionDynamicRebuildHierarchy`` (external)
    Using conduction can often result in the code taking extremely short timesteps.  Since the hierarchy is rebuilt each timestep, this can exacerbate memory fragmentation issues and slow the simulation.  In the case where the conduction timestep is the limiter, the hierarchy should not need to be rebuilt every timestep since conduction mostly does not alter the fields which control refinement.  When this option is used, the timestep calculation is carried out as usual, but the hierarchy is only rebuilt on a timescale that is calculated neglecting the conduction timestep.  This results in a decent speedup and reduced memory fragmentation when running with conduction.  (1 - ON; 0 - OFF)  Default: 0 (OFF).
``ConductionDynamicRebuildMinLevel`` (external)
    The minimum level on which the dynamic hierarcy rebuild is performed.  Default: 0.


.. _sgs_parameters:

Subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameter allow the use of an SGS turbulence model in
Enzo, see test problem
``run/MHD/3D/StochasticForcing/StochasticForcing.enzo``.

It is recommended to not arbitrarily mix model terms, but either
stick to one model family (nonlinear, dissipative, or scale-similarity)
or conduct additional *a priori* test first.

Best fit model coefficients based on *a priori* testing of compressible
MHD turbulence for a wide range of sonic Mach numbers (0.2 to 20) can
be found in Table II in `Grete et al. (2016) Physics of Plasmas 23 062317
<https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4954304>`_,
where all models are presented in more detail.

Overall, the nonlinear model (effectively parameter free)
with an explicit 3-point stencil showed the
best performance in decaying MHD test problem, see
`Grete et al. (2017) Phys. Rev. E. 95 033206
<https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.033206>`_.


``UseSGSModel`` (external)
    This parameter generally turns the SGS machinery on (even though
    no SGS term is added by default as every term needs a coefficient,
    see below).
    1: Turn on. Default: 0

Explicit filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All SGS models rely on the notion that they are calculated based on
filtered/resolved quantities.
The spatial discretization itself acts as one filter.
However, in shock-capturing schemes it is questionable how "resolved"
quantities are at the grid-scale.
The following three variables enable the explicit filtering of the grid-scale
quantites as they are used in the SGS terms.

See Table 1 in `Grete et al. (2017) Phys. Rev. E. 95 033206
<https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.033206>`_ for coefficients
of a discrete box filter.

on a 3-point stencil.

.. _shocktube_param:

Shock Tube (1: unigrid and AMR)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Riemann problem or arbitrary discontinuity breakup problem. The
    discontinuity initially separates two arbitrary constant states:
    Left and Right. Default values correspond to the so called Sod
    Shock Tube setup (test 1.1). A table below contains a series of
    recommended 1D tests for hydrodynamic method, specifically designed
    to test the performance of the Riemann solver, the treatment of
    shock waves, contact discontinuities, and rarefaction waves in a
    variety of situations (Toro 1999, p. 129).

    It is also possible to set up a second discontinuity, creating three
    initial regions, rather than the two regions of the original Sod Shock
    Tube.

.. _khinstability_param:

Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (8)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    This problem sets up a 2D box with periodic boundary conditions containing
    two fluids (inner fluid and outer fluid).  The inner fluid has a positive
    velocity and the outer fluid has a negative velocity with a difference of
    ``KHVelocityJump``.  The two fluids typically have different densities.
    The result is the build up of KH instabilities along the interface between
    the two fluids.

    Setting ``KHRamp`` to 0, creates the standard KH test problem
    where there is a discontinuous jump between the two fluids in
    x-velocity and density.  Random perturbations in y-velocity are the seeds
    to the KH instability resulting in growth of multiple modes of the KHI.

    Setting ``KHRamp`` to 1 modifies the ICs so that there is a smooth
    ramp connecting the two fluids in x-velocity and density of width
    ``KHRampWidth``.  A sinusoidal perturbation in y-velocity is the seed
    to the KH instability resulting in only growth of k=2 modes.
    These results converge in behavior as resolution is increased, whereas
    the standard ICs do not.  The ramped ICs are based on Robertson, Kravtsov,
    Gnedin, Abel & Rudd 2010, but that work has a typo in the ramp equation,
    and this implementation matches Robertson's actual ICs.

``KHBulkVelocity`` (external)

``KHVelocityJump`` (external)

    Inner fluid will have half this value and move to the right (positive),
    whereas outer fluid will have have this value and move to the left
    (negative).  Total fluid velocities will combine this jump with
    KHBulkVelocity.  Default: 1.0
``KHPerturbationAmplitude`` (external)
    Default: 0.1
``KHRamp`` (external)
    Whether to use ramped ICs or not.  Default: 1
``KHRampWidth`` (external)

    The seed for the Mersennes random number generator.  This is only
    used in the case of the KHRamp=0 ICs.  By using the same seed
    from one run to the next, one can reproduce previous behavior with
    identical parameter files.  Default: 123456789

    number of particles and cells are used (128 particles along an edge
    and 256 cells along an edge, for example) Enzo attempts to
    calculate the appropriate particle mass. This breaks down when
    ``ParallelRootGridIO`` and/or ``ParallelParticleIO`` are turned on,
    however, so the user must set this by hand. If you have the ratio
    described above (2 cells per particle along each edge of a 3D
    simulation) the appropriate value would be 8.0 (in other words,
    this should be set to (number of cells along an edge) / (number of

    with a Center region in addition to the Left and Right regions.
    Finally, there are two special cases -- if
    HydroShockTubesCenterCREnDensity is set to 123.4, then the central
    region will be set to a ramp between the left and right regions,
    and if HydroShockTubesCenterCREnDensity is set to 567.8, then a
    gaussian CR energy density is initialized (these problems were set
    up to test the CR diffusion).
