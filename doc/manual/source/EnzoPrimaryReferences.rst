Enzo Primary References
=======================

The Enzo method paper is not yet complete. However, there are several papers
that describe the numerical methods used in Enzo, and this documentation
contains a brief outline of the essential physics in Enzo, in
:ref:`EnzoAlgorithms`.  Two general references (that should be considered to
stand in for the method paper) are:


*  ` Introducing Enzo, an AMR Cosmology Application <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:astro-ph/0403044>`_

Three somewhat older conferences proceedings are also relevant:

The primary hydrodynamics methods are PPM and ZEUS, as described in
the following two papers:
