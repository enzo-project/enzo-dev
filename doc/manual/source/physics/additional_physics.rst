Additional Physics
==================



Thermal Conduction
------------------

Enzo supports both isotropic and anisotropic thermal conduction within the gas.
The isotropic conduction was use in `Smith et al. (2013)
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...778..152S>`_. 
The anisotropic conduction is directionally split.
The methods are adapted from `Parrish and Stone, 2005
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005ApJ...633..334P>`_ and the parameters can be
found under :ref:`conduction`.
